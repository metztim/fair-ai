# Claude Context

## Project Overview

Feasibility research for launching "Consumer Reports for AI" — an independent organization rating AI companies on ethics, safety, labor practices, and governance.

**Status:** Research complete. Decision pending on positioning (ethics vs. compliance framing).

## Key Documents

- `README.md` — Project summary and current verdict
- `docs/ONE-PAGER.md` — Condensed overview of findings
- `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` — Philosophical foundations for execution
- `docs/research/` — Detailed research (12 documents, ~15k lines)
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — Session history

## Guiding Principles

Read `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` before advising on strategy, marketing, or publishing decisions.

Core test for any publishing/content decision:
> "If this got zero engagement, would I still be glad I made it?"
> If yes — service. If no — ego.

## Tone for This Project

- Direct and honest over flattering
- Buddhist-informed: non-attachment to outcomes, right motivation, patience
- Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization
- The work IS the marketing — focus on making it genuinely useful
