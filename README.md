# AI Watchdog Research Project

**Status:** Research phase complete. Decision pending.
**Last Updated:** November 28, 2025

## Quick Start for New Sessions

```
"Continue AI watchdog project - read README.md and docs/SESSION_LOG.md for context."

## Project Summary

Feasibility research for launching a "Consumer Reports for AI" - an organization that rates AI companies on ethics, safety, labor practices, and governance.

### Current Verdict: CONDITIONAL GO (with caveats)

**The opportunity is real:**
- No comprehensive AI ethics ratings exist for enterprise procurement
- EU AI Act enforcement begins August 2025 (creates compliance demand)
- 30-50 companies is viable Year 1 scope
- AI enables 3-person team to match 20-person traditional team

**The key insight (Nov 27-28):**
- Enterprises care about AI ethics, but driven by **compliance/liability fear**, not ethics
- Position as "AI Vendor Risk Assessment" not "AI Ethics Ratings"
- Lead with regulatory penalties (€35M / 7% revenue) not moral arguments

**Open questions:**
1. Does compliance framing fit Tim's skills/interests, or too far from original vision?
2. If compliance: Need co-founder/advisor with regulatory expertise
3. If ethics: Accept smaller market but better founder fit

## Key Findings by Topic

### Business Model Options

| Model | Impact | Year 3 Revenue | Founder Fit |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Newsletter/Media | LOW-MODERATE | $300k-$1M | HIGH |
| Research Firm | MODERATE-HIGH | $1-3M | MODERATE |
| Certification Body | HIGH | $2-5M | LOWER (needs compliance expertise) |

### Market Size

- 70,000+ AI companies exist globally
- **100-500 are procurement-relevant** for enterprises
- **30-50 companies** is viable Year 1 coverage
- Exceeds all existing ethics rating services (SaferAI: 20, Stanford FMTI: 14)

### Enterprise Demand Reality

| What They Say | What Drives Decisions |
|---------------|----------------------|
| "We care about ethics" | Regulatory compliance (mandatory) |
| "Responsible AI matters" | Legal liability (lawsuits) |
| "Values alignment" | ROI & performance (measurable) |

**Ethics ranks 17%** in procurement criteria vs **35% for operational benchmarks**.

### The Positioning Dilemma

**Ethics framing:**
- Better founder fit
- Smaller market
- Journalism/accountability angle
- Target: Journalists, investors, policy staff, values-driven enterprises

**Compliance framing:**
- Larger market
- Requires regulatory expertise (hire/advise/co-founder)
- Risk assessment angle
- Target: Procurement, legal, compliance teams

## Session History

See `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` for detailed session logs.

**Nov 26:** Initial research (Areas 1-5), Sacra analysis, founder credibility, competitive landscape, financial viability, location analysis

**Nov 26 (cont):** Executive synthesis document

**Nov 27:** Business scenarios report, certification economics, AI-native operations, impact mechanisms

**Nov 27-28:** Company universe sizing (30-50 viable), enterprise demand reality check (compliance-driven, not ethics-driven)

---

## Next Decision Required

**The fork in the road:**

1. **Pursue ethics/journalism angle** (better founder fit, smaller market)
   - Start with Newsletter → Research Firm evolution
   - Target values-driven buyers + journalists + investors
   - Tim can do this without compliance co-founder

2. **Pursue compliance angle** (larger market, needs team)
   - Position as "AI Vendor Risk Assessment"
   - Requires regulatory expertise (advisor or co-founder)
   - Target procurement/legal/compliance teams

3. **Hybrid approach** (start ethics, build toward compliance)
   - Begin with journalism/ratings (founder fit)
   - Build compliance-ready outputs over time
   - Add regulatory expertise as you grow
