# AI Watchdog: One-Pager

## The Idea
Build a **"Consumer Reports for AI"** — an independent organization that rates AI companies on ethics, safety, labor practices, copyright, environment, and governance.

---

## Why Now?
- **No one is doing this comprehensively.** SaferAI covers safety (20 companies). Stanford FMTI covers transparency (14 models). Labor practices, children's safety, environmental impact? Nearly zero coverage.
- **EU AI Act enforcement starts August 2025** — creates hard compliance requirements
- **84% of consumers want AI labeling** — proven demand exists
- **Enterprise procurement increasingly requires ethics due diligence**

---

## The Hard Truth (Key Insight from Research)
Enterprises say they care about AI ethics. They don't — not really.

| What They Say | What Actually Drives Decisions |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| "We care about ethics" | Regulatory compliance (mandatory) |
| "Responsible AI matters" | Legal liability (lawsuits) |
| "Values alignment" | ROI & performance (measurable) |

**Ethics ranks 17%** in procurement criteria vs **35% for operational benchmarks.**

→ Position as **"AI Vendor Risk Assessment"** not "AI Ethics Ratings" if targeting enterprise buyers.

## The Fork in the Road

| Path | Market Size | Founder Fit | What's Needed |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Ethics/Journalism** | Smaller | HIGH | Solo viable |
| **Compliance/Risk** | Larger | LOWER | Regulatory expertise (co-founder/advisor) |
| **Hybrid** | Medium | MODERATE | Start ethics, build toward compliance |

---

## Business Model Options

| Model | Year 3 Revenue | Impact Potential |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Newsletter/Media | $300k-$1M | Low-Moderate |
| Research Firm (Sacra-style) | $1-3M | Moderate-High |
| Certification Body | $2-5M | High |

## Founder: Tim Soulo
- **Current role:** Director of Marketing & Innovation at Animalz (~$130k/yr)
- **Strengths:** Content strategy, AI workflows (50+ production systems), audience building, B2B relationships
- **Gaps:** No investigative journalism background, no AI safety research credentials, limited policy network
- **Location:** Thailand (cost advantage: 2x runway vs US)
- **Key asset:** Direct access to Walter Chen (Sacra founder, Animalz owner) — the closest business model parallel

**Founder credibility score: 3/5 now → 4/5 with right advisors**

---

## Numbers That Matter
- **70,000+ AI companies exist globally** — 100-500 are enterprise-procurement-relevant
- **30-50 companies = viable Year 1 scope** (exceeds all existing rating services)
- **$6,000-7,500/month burn** (Thailand, family of 4)
- **40-60% probability** of replacing $130k income within 24 months

---

## The Path Forward
1. **Validate while employed** (6 months) — 2,000 newsletter subscribers, 25 paid beta users
2. **Negotiate transition** — 60% time at Animalz + consulting bridge
3. **Full independence** by Month 18-24

**Kill switch:** If <$7k/month combined revenue for 2 consecutive months → revert to employment

---

## Open Questions
1. Does compliance framing fit Tim's skills/interests, or is it too far from original vision?
2. Who would be the ideal co-founder/advisor with regulatory expertise?
3. Is the ethics-focused smaller market acceptable if it means better founder fit?

---

## Verdict: CONDITIONAL GO
The opportunity is real. The timing is right. The model exists (Sacra proves it). But success requires:
- Clear positioning choice (ethics vs compliance)
- Advisory board for credibility gaps
- Disciplined transition with reversion triggers
- Family buy-in on 30-40% income reduction risk in Year 1
