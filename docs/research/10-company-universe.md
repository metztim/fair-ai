**Research Date:** November 27, 2025
**Focus:** Determining realistic coverage scope for an AI ethics rating service

---

## Executive Summary

The AI company universe varies dramatically based on definition (33K-212K companies globally), but the **enterprise-relevant market is much smaller**. For procurement teams, the actionable universe is approximately **100-500 companies** across foundation models, enterprise platforms, and AI-powered tools.

**Key Recommendation:** An AI ethics rating service should target **30-50 companies in Year 1**, expanding to **100-150 by Year 3**, focusing on foundation model providers and enterprise AI platforms that procurement teams actively evaluate.

   - CB Insights AI 100: Top 100 private companies
   - Public AI leaders: ~10-15 companies

### Realistic Coverage Scope

#### Minimum Viable Coverage (MVP): 15-20 Companies
**Rationale**: Cover the absolute essentials that every procurement team evaluates
- 10 foundation model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, AWS, Microsoft, NVIDIA, IBM)
- 5-10 enterprise AI platforms (Databricks, DataRobot, H2O.ai, Snowflake, etc.)

**Comparison**: SaferAI currently rates 12 companies (insufficient for broad utility)

#### Year 1 Target: 30-50 Companies
**Rationale**: Achieve critical mass for procurement utility
- 15 foundation model providers (expand beyond top 10)
- 15 enterprise AI platforms (cover major categories)
- 10-20 category leaders in vertical AI (healthcare, legal, finance)

**Market Position**: Exceed Stanford FMTI (14 companies) and SaferAI (20 companies), approaching CB Insights top 50

#### Year 3 Target: 100-150 Companies
**Rationale**: Comprehensive coverage of procurement-relevant vendors
- 25-30 foundation models/LLM providers
- 30-40 enterprise AI platforms (all major categories)
- 30-50 vertical AI leaders (top 5-10 per major industry)
- 15-30 AI infrastructure providers (MLOps, data labeling, etc.)

**Market Position**: Match CB Insights AI 100 coverage depth, exceed all existing ethics rating services

#### Long-term Vision: 200-300 Companies
**Rationale**: Near-complete coverage of enterprise AI vendor landscape
- Covers procurement evaluation universe for 95%+ of enterprises
- Includes emerging players and category expansion
- Maintains competitive moat against alternatives

### Recommended Initial Focus

**Priority 1: Foundation Models (15 companies, Year 1)**

- Matches Stanford FMTI's scope but with ethics focus

**Priority 2: Enterprise AI Platforms (15 companies, Year 1)**
- Critical procurement decisions ($1M-$2.6M per use case)
- No existing ethics ratings in this category
- High-value B2B customers

**Priority 3: Vertical AI Leaders (10-20 companies, Year 1)**
- Start with healthcare (highest enterprise spend: $500M)
- Add legal (strong ROI visibility: $100K/lawyer)
- Add finance (21.5% of vertical AI market)

**Priority 4: AI Infrastructure (Year 2+)**
- Lower priority: Often technical rather than ethical concerns
- Focus on data labeling first (ethical sourcing issues)

### Why These Numbers Work

1. **Procurement Reality**: Enterprises evaluate 5-10 vendors per category, shortlist 3-5
   - 30-50 companies covers 3-5 categories comprehensively
   - 100-150 companies covers 10-15 categories (full procurement universe)

2. **Competitive Positioning**:

## Conclusion

**The Answer**: For an AI ethics rating service targeting enterprise procurement, the realistic scope is:

- **Total AI companies globally**: 33K-212K (depending on definition)
- **Enterprise procurement-relevant universe**: 100-500 companies
- **High-priority core**: 50-100 companies (actively evaluated in most RFPs)

**Recommended Coverage**:
- **Minimum viable**: 15-20 companies (establish credibility)
- **Year 1 target**: 30-50 companies (achieve procurement utility)
- **Year 3 target**: 100-150 companies (comprehensive coverage)
- **Long-term vision**: 200-300 companies (market leadership)

**Why this works**:
1. Enterprises typically evaluate 5-10 vendors per category, shortlist 3-5
2. Covering 30-50 companies = 3-5 categories comprehensively
3. Covering 100-150 companies = 10-15 categories (full procurement universe)
4. Existing services (SaferAI: 20, FMTI: 14) are too narrow
5. Market opportunity: $227M → $1.4B AI governance market by 2030
