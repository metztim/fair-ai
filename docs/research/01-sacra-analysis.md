# Sacra Business Model Analysis

**Research Date:** November 26, 2025
**Researcher:** Claude (for Tim Soulo)
**Purpose:** Evaluate Sacra as comparable for AI ethics watchdog venture

---

## Executive Summary

Sacra is a private markets research platform founded in 2020 by Walter Chen (Animalz founder/CEO) and Jan-Erik Asplund (Animalz employee #3). The company successfully spun out from Animalz after identifying a significant market gap: the absence of Bloomberg/Morningstar-equivalent research for private companies.

Within 4+ years, Sacra has built credible authority in private markets research, covering 344+ companies with 13,000+ email subscribers and securing partnerships with major platforms like EquityZen and Nasdaq Private Market. The company raised $1M in seed funding (June 2020) and operates with a lean team of 4-10 people, generating revenue through tiered subscriptions ranging from $500/year (individual) to $15,000+/year (platform/enterprise).

**Key relevance for AI watchdog venture:** Sacra demonstrates that a small, highly-focused research team can establish credibility and build sustainable revenue in an underserved information market by combining rigorous data analysis with compelling storytelling, leveraging content marketing expertise, and starting with a clear value proposition for a specific audience (investors/employees in private markets).

## Team & Operations

### Team Size & Structure

**Current team:** 4-10 employees (sources vary - Tracxn reports 4 as of Dec 2023, PitchBook reports 10 in 2024)

### Content Production

**Three-step research process:**

1. **Data Foundation**
   - Build spreadsheet-based financial models
   - Start with disclosed company financials (SEC filings, press releases, public statements)
   - Work backward to estimate undisclosed metrics using valuation data
   - Question: "What would that company actually look like at that size at that scale?"

2. **Expert Validation**

   - Mix of paid consultations and voluntary contributions
   - Some attributed, others anonymized
   - Backchanneling with startup insiders to verify figures and fill information gaps

3. **Narrative Layer**
   - Transform raw data through storytelling techniques learned from Animalz
   - Deploy "golden nuggets" - visual charts highlighting core insights
   - Use unusual comparisons (e.g., "Zapier is the $7B Netflix of productivity")
   - Emphasize accessibility: "Dry data turns off people's brains"

**Content types produced:**
- Company one-pagers and profiles (150+ in database)
- Deep-dive company reports with revenue models
- Q&A interviews (1,211+ published pairs)
- Market analysis and sector trends
- Weekly personalized email digests (via Sacra News API)

### Publication Cadence

**Volume:** 344+ private companies covered, expanded 10x from initial 40 companies

- Weekly email digests to 13,000+ subscribers
- Q&A publication appears ongoing (1,211+ interviews completed)
- Major company reports appear episodic rather than scheduled

**Quality over cadence:** Animalz DNA prioritizes depth and accuracy over publishing velocity

## Credibility Building

### Launch Strategy

**Origin story (2020):**
1. Walter Chen (Animalz founder) and Jan-Erik Asplund identified market gap while doing private markets research for VC clients at Animalz
2. Carta was launching CartaX ("Nasdaq for private markets") and needed "sell-side research on private companies"
3. Walter secured relationship through Arjun Sethi (Social Capital) to Carta CEO Henry Ward
4. Team worked intensively (led by Jan-Erik and Nan Wang) to create research for CartaX early 2021 deadline
5. **Pivot moment:** Carta's legal team decided to launch without third-party research
6. Rather than shut down, founders "went out for a drink underneath the george best mural at bar bruno in carroll gardens" and decided to "publish our research direct to the people"

**First major publication:** "The Privately-Traded Company: The $225 Billion Market for Pre-IPO Liquidity" (September 2020)

- AI watchdog addresses similar gap (trustworthy AI ethics evaluation for consumers)
- Both serve audiences making high-stakes decisions with insufficient reliable information

**Lean team can build credibility:**
- 4-10 person team established authority in complex, technical domain
- Quality research with clear methodology beats large-scale content production
- Expertise + transparency + consistency = credibility

**Subscription model is viable:**

## Key Differences to Account For

### 1. Audience Sophistication

**Sacra:** Professional investors with financial literacy, comfortable with estimates and models
**AI Watchdog:** General consumers with varying technical literacy, need extreme clarity

**Implication:** AI watchdog must prioritize accessibility even more than Sacra. Scoring must be simple (letter grades, 1-10 scales) while methodology detail available for those who want it.

### 2. Information Availability

**Sacra:** Some disclosed financials, valuation data from funding rounds, secondary market trades
**AI Watchdog:** Limited transparency from AI companies, must rely heavily on testing and user reports

**Implication:** AI watchdog must invest more in primary research (direct testing) and less in model-building from disclosed data. Community reporting becomes critical.

### 3. Update Cadence

**Sacra:** Companies change slowly (quarterly/annual updates sufficient)
**AI Watchdog:** AI tools update constantly (weekly model updates, new features, policy changes)

**Implication:** AI watchdog needs systems for continuous monitoring and rapid re-evaluation. Cannot be purely episodic research.

### 4. Monetization Pressure

**Sacra:** B2B customers expect to pay for financial research, established willingness to pay
**AI Watchdog:** Consumer market less accustomed to paying for safety information, expects free access

**Implication:** Freemium model more critical for AI watchdog. Free tier must be robust enough to build trust and user base. Revenue likely tilts more toward enterprise/platform tiers than individual subscriptions.

### 5. Regulatory Environment

**Sacra:** Private markets research has established norms, limited liability for estimates
**AI Watchdog:** AI safety is emerging regulatory space, potential liability for "wrong" ratings

**Implication:** AI watchdog needs stronger legal review, clear disclaimers, focus on methodology transparency over absolute judgments. May need insurance or legal defense fund.

### 6. Stakeholder Dynamics

**Sacra:** Companies generally cooperative (want positive coverage to support valuations)
**AI Watchdog:** AI companies may be adversarial to critical safety ratings, potential legal threats

**Implication:** AI watchdog must be prepared for pushback, SLAPP suits, need strong editorial independence and potentially legal defense resources.

### 7. Subject Matter Expertise

**Sacra:** Financial analysis, business model evaluation (Jan-Erik and team's existing skills)
**AI Watchdog:** AI safety, ethics, bias detection, technical evaluation (requires different expertise)

**Implication:** Tim needs co-founder or early hires with AI safety/ML expertise. Cannot bootstrap with just marketing/content skills.

### 8. Social Mission Component

**Sacra:** Commercial information service, value is better investment decisions
**AI Watchdog:** Consumer protection mission, value includes social good and policy influence

**Implication:** AI watchdog may attract grant funding, non-profit partnerships, volunteer researchers. Could consider hybrid for-profit/non-profit structure. Mission-driven positioning critical for credibility.
