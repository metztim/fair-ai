# Business Scenarios: AI Ethics Ratings Venture
## Three Paths from Day 0 to Impact

**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Focus:** Business model analysis with impact potential as primary lens

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents three distinct business models for an AI ethics ratings venture, evaluated primarily on their ability to change AI company behavior. Each model represents a different theory of change:

| Model | Impact Vector | Year 3 Revenue Potential | Team Size |
|-------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **A. Newsletter/Media** | Shapes public conversation | $300k-$1M | 1-3 |
| **B. Research Firm** | Influences procurement & investment | $1-3M | 4-8 |
| **C. Certification Body** | Creates market incentive | $2-5M | 8-15 |

**Key Finding:** Impact research shows consumer awareness alone has LOW effect on corporate behavior. The most powerful mechanisms are: (1) enterprise procurement requirements, (2) regulatory/legal liability, and (3) coordinated investor pressure. This suggests Model B (Research Firm) or Model C (Certification) will drive more behavior change than Model A (Newsletter), despite Model A being easiest to launch.

**The AI Advantage:** What required 20+ staff in 2015 can now be done by 2-3 people. One person with AI matches a two-person team without it. This changes the economics of all three models dramatically.

## The 2015 vs 2025 Leverage Point

Before diving into models, understand what's changed:

| Function | 2015 Requirement | 2025 Requirement | Multiplier |
|----------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| Company research (deep) | 2-3 analysts, 2 weeks | 1 person, 2 days | 5-7x |
| Continuous monitoring (50 companies) | 5-person newsroom | 1 person + AI systems | 5x |
| Rating methodology consistency | Team + manual QA | Methodology-as-code | 10x+ |
| Multi-source intelligence | Specialized departments | AI synthesis | 8-10x |
| Report production | Writers + editors + designers | AI drafts + human judgment | 4-6x |

**Bottom line:** A 3-person team in 2025 can match the output of a 20-person team in 2015 for this specific type of work.

This doesn't mean you should stay tiny forever—but it means you can validate and launch with minimal capital, then scale with revenue rather than requiring large upfront investment.

## Model A: Newsletter/Media Operation

### What It Is

The Stratechery/Ben Thompson model applied to AI ethics. A subscription newsletter with a strong individual voice, building influence through analysis and opinion.

**Positioning:** "The definitive voice on AI company ethics"
**Legal structure:** LLC or sole proprietorship
**Primary audience:** Tech-aware consumers, journalists, policy staff, AI practitioners

### The Product

- **Free tier:** Weekly analysis of AI ethics news and developments
- **Paid tier ($15-30/month or $150-300/year):**
  - Daily briefings
  - Company ratings and analysis
  - Exclusive research reports
  - Community access (Discord/forum)

### Day 0 → Year 3 Roadmap

**Day 0-Month 3: Foundation**
- Launch free newsletter on Substack/Beehiiv
- Publish 2-3x weekly
- Build initial audience (target: 2,000 free subscribers)
- Establish voice and methodology
- AI workflow: Use Claude/Perplexity for research compilation, monitoring

**Month 4-6: Validation**
- Launch paid tier
- Target: 100 paid subscribers ($15k-30k ARR)
- Publish first company ratings (start with 5-10 major AI companies)
- Build relationships with journalists who might cite you

**Month 7-12: Growth**
- Target: 500 paid subscribers ($75k-150k ARR)
- Expand company coverage to 20-30 companies
- First media citations and pickups
- Consider hiring part-time editor/researcher

**Year 2: Establishment**
- Target: 2,000 paid subscribers ($300k-600k ARR)
- Regular media citations
- Speaking invitations
- Podcast or video content
- Team of 2-3

**Year 3: Scale**
- Target: 5,000+ paid subscribers ($750k-1.5M ARR)
- Recognized industry authority
- B2B crossover (enterprise subscriptions)
- Team of 3-5

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost to produce one weekly analysis | $200-400 (time + AI tools) |
| Subscriber acquisition cost | $5-20 (organic/content-driven) |
| Annual subscription price | $150-300 |
| Churn rate (Substack average) | 5-10% monthly |
| Break-even subscribers | 500-1,000 |

**Tools cost:** ~$500/month (Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, monitoring tools, email platform)

### How AI Enables This

**Research Production:**
- AI deep research compiles company information in hours, not days
- Cross-references news, SEC filings, job postings, social media automatically
- One person can maintain current knowledge on 50+ companies

**Monitoring:**
- AI-powered alerts for policy changes, incidents, announcements
- What required a newsroom monitoring desk now requires RSS + AI summarization
- "Commitment drift" detection: comparing company promises to actions

**Content Production:**
- AI drafts speed up writing 3-4x
- Maintains consistency across hundreds of company analyses
- Enables daily output that would otherwise require a team

### Impact Analysis

**How this changes AI company behavior:**

| Mechanism | Effectiveness | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Public pressure via media amplification | MODERATE | Requires viral moments |
| Journalist citations | MODERATE-HIGH | Media uses you as source |
| Consumer awareness | LOW | Research shows limited behavior change |
| Enterprise procurement | LOW | Not designed for B2B |
| Regulatory influence | LOW-MODERATE | Depends on reputation built |

**Honest assessment:** This model builds INFLUENCE but has limited direct IMPACT on company behavior. Companies care about newsletters when they affect hiring, investor sentiment, or create PR crises. A newsletter alone rarely creates sufficient pressure for behavior change.

**Best for:** Someone who wants to build a media voice first, potentially evolving into higher-impact models later.

### Failure Modes

1. **Audience plateau:** Newsletter growth stalls at 5,000-10,000 free subscribers; can't convert to paid
2. **Voice competition:** AI ethics space gets crowded; hard to differentiate
3. **Burnout:** Daily/weekly publishing schedule unsustainable for solo operator
4. **Credibility attacks:** "Just a blogger" dismissal from companies
5. **Platform risk:** Substack policy changes, algorithm shifts

---

## Model B: Research Firm (Sacra Model)

### What It Is

A B2B intelligence service providing company ratings, research reports, and data to enterprise buyers, investors, journalists, and policy staff. The Sacra/CB Insights model applied to AI ethics.

**Positioning:** "The Bloomberg of AI ethics intelligence"
**Legal structure:** Delaware C-Corp or Public Benefit Corporation
**Primary audience:** Enterprise procurement, VC/PE investors, journalists, policy researchers

### The Product

**Tiered subscriptions:**
| Tier | Annual Price | Target | Features |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Standard | $500-1,000 | Individual researchers | Company profiles, ratings, basic reports |
| Professional | $2,500-5,000 | Teams, small funds | Full database, export, quarterly deep dives |
| Enterprise | $10,000-25,000 | Large enterprises, major investors | API access, custom research, dedicated support |
| Platform | $50,000+ | Platforms integrating your data | White-label ratings, full API |

**Additional revenue streams:**
- Bespoke research projects ($5k-50k each)
- Data licensing to third parties
- Speaking/consulting

### Day 0 → Year 3 Roadmap

**Day 0-Month 6: Foundation**
- Develop rating methodology (documented, reproducible)
- Build initial database: 20-30 company profiles
- Create MVP platform (could be Notion/Airtable initially)
- Secure 5-10 pilot customers (free or heavily discounted)
- AI workflow: Methodology codified into prompts; AI compiles evidence

**Month 7-12: Launch**
- Launch paid subscriptions
- Target: $100k ARR (mix of Standard/Professional)
- Expand coverage to 50+ companies
- Hire first researcher/analyst
- First enterprise pilot conversations

**Year 2: Growth**
- Target: $500k-1M ARR
- 100+ company coverage
- 3-5 person team
- First enterprise contracts ($25k+)
- API/data licensing discussions
- Regular citations in major media

**Year 3: Scale**
- Target: $1.5-3M ARR
- 200+ company coverage
- 5-10 person team
- Multiple enterprise contracts
- Platform partnerships (like Sacra/EquityZen)
- Considered authoritative source

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost to produce one company profile (initial) | $500-2,000 (depending on depth) |
| Cost to maintain one company profile (ongoing) | $100-300/quarter |
| Average revenue per customer | $2,000-5,000/year |
| Customer acquisition cost (B2B) | $500-2,000 |
| Churn rate | 10-20% annually |
| Break-even customers | 50-100 |

**Staffing cost assumption:** $80k-120k per researcher/analyst (Thailand = lower)

### How AI Enables This

**Methodology as Code:**
- Rating criteria codified into reproducible prompts
- One analyst can maintain consistency across 100+ company evaluations
- Version-controlled methodology enables auditing and improvement
- AI doesn't make judgments—it compiles evidence against defined criteria

**Evidence Compilation:**
- AI cross-references 10+ source types per company:
  - SEC/public filings
  - Job postings (labor practices signals)
  - Glassdoor/Blind (employee sentiment)
  - News coverage
  - Policy documents
  - Patent/paper filings
  - Social media
  - Government contracts
- What took 2-3 analysts 2 weeks per company now takes 1 person 2 days

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- AI-powered alerts for all covered companies
- Daily updates vs. annual (traditional rating agencies)
- "Commitment drift" tracking: did they do what they said?

**Scale math:**
| Team Size | Deep Coverage | Medium Coverage | Light Monitoring |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 person | 20-30 companies | 50 companies | 100+ companies |
| 3 people | 75-100 companies | 150 companies | 300+ companies |
| Traditional (no AI) | 10-20 analysts for 100 companies | - | - |

### Impact Analysis

**How this changes AI company behavior:**

| Mechanism | Effectiveness | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Enterprise procurement | HIGH | Companies need good ratings to win contracts |
| Investor due diligence | HIGH | VCs/PE use ratings in decisions |
| Journalist citations | MODERATE-HIGH | Media uses you as authoritative source |
| Regulatory evidence | MODERATE-HIGH | Policymakers cite your research |
| Consumer awareness | LOW | B2B model, not consumer-facing |

**Why this model has more impact than Newsletter:**
1. **Enterprise procurement creates financial consequences.** If your rating affects whether a company wins a contract, they WILL care.
2. **Investor integration creates capital consequences.** If VCs use your ratings in due diligence, companies seeking funding will care.
3. **Institutional credibility.** Research firm > blogger in perceived authority.

**The B Corp lesson:** B Corp succeeded NOT through consumer pressure (75% of population still unfamiliar) but through B2B network effects and companies wanting third-party verification. Same logic applies here.

### Failure Modes

1. **Can't crack enterprise sales:** B2B sales cycles are long; need patience and relationships
2. **Methodology criticized:** Academic/technical community attacks your criteria
3. **Data quality issues:** Errors in high-profile ratings damage credibility
4. **Funding gap:** Needs 12-18 months runway before meaningful revenue
5. **Competition from incumbents:** SaferAI, FLI, Stanford FMTI improve and expand

## Model C: Certification Body (Fair Trade / B Corp Model)

### What It Is

A standards organization where AI companies PAY for evaluation and certification. Creates an "Ethical AI" seal that companies can use in marketing, similar to B Corp, Fair Trade, or LEED.

**Positioning:** "The B Corp for AI"
**Legal structure:** 501(c)(3) nonprofit (enables foundation funding + perceived independence)
**Primary audience:** AI companies seeking differentiation; enterprises requiring certified suppliers

### The Product

**Certification program:**
- Initial evaluation fee: $10,000-75,000 (based on company size)
- Annual licensing fee: $3,000-50,000 (based on company revenue)
- Re-certification every 3 years
- Ongoing monitoring and compliance

**Tiered pricing (based on B Corp model):**
| Company Revenue | Initial Evaluation | Annual License |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| <$5M | $10,000 | $3,000 |
| $5M-$25M | $20,000 | $8,000 |
| $25M-$100M | $35,000 | $15,000 |
| $100M-$500M | $50,000 | $25,000 |
| $500M+ | $75,000+ | $50,000+ |

**What companies get:**
- "Ethical AI Certified" seal for marketing
- Inclusion in certified company directory
- Use of certification in RFPs/procurement
- Annual review and feedback
- Community of certified companies

### Day 0 → Year 3 Roadmap

**Day 0-Month 12: Foundation (THE HARD PART)**
- Develop comprehensive certification standards
- Build advisory board with academic/industry credibility
- Secure initial foundation funding ($500k-1M)
- Pilot with 5-10 companies (discounted/free)
- Build assessment platform and processes

**Year 2: Launch**
- Public launch of certification program
- Target: 25-50 certified companies
- Revenue: $300k-800k
- Team: 5-8 people
- Marketing campaign for consumer/enterprise awareness

**Year 3: Growth**
- Target: 100-200 certified companies
- Revenue: $1.5-3M
- Team: 10-15 people
- Enterprise procurement adoption
- Regulatory recognition discussions

**Year 5 (vision):**
- 500+ certified companies
- Revenue: $5-10M
- Industry-standard certification
- Regulatory integration

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost to evaluate one company | $5,000-15,000 |
| Revenue per certified company | ~$15,000-25,000/year (evaluation amortized + annual) |
| Certification success rate | 30-50% (like B Corp) |
| Staff per certification | 0.5-1 FTE equivalent |
| Break-even certified companies | 75-100 |

**B Corp comparison:** 9,576 certified companies, ~$78.5M annual revenue, 221 staff = ~$8,200 revenue per company

### How AI Enables This

**Assessment Automation:**
- AI pre-screens applications against criteria
- Compiles evidence from public sources before human review
- Reduces evaluation time from weeks to days for initial assessment
- Human judgment remains for final certification decisions

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- AI monitors certified companies for compliance
- Flags potential violations for human review
- Enables "living certification" vs. point-in-time snapshot
- What would require a compliance team now requires AI + 1-2 humans

**Scale math:**
- Traditional certification body: 20+ staff for 1,000 certifications
- AI-enabled: 8-10 staff for same scale
- Cost savings enable lower pricing, faster adoption

### Impact Analysis

**How this changes AI company behavior:**

| Mechanism | Effectiveness | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Market incentive | HIGHEST | Companies PAY for certification = they care |
| Enterprise procurement | HIGH | "Must be certified" requirements |
| Marketing differentiation | MODERATE-HIGH | Companies use seal in marketing |
| Consumer awareness | MODERATE | If seal becomes recognized |
| Regulatory integration | HIGH POTENTIAL | Could become compliance pathway |

**Why certification has highest impact potential:**
1. **Incentive alignment.** Companies that seek certification are self-selected for caring. They become advocates.
2. **Continuous improvement.** B Corp data: 63% of companies improved scores at recertification.
3. **Network effects.** Certified companies prefer doing business with other certified companies.
4. **Procurement integration.** Once enterprises require certification, it becomes table stakes.

**The B Corp lesson:** B Corp grew to 9,500+ companies mostly through VALUES alignment, not consumer pressure. Companies certified because they wanted third-party verification they were "walking the talk." Consumer awareness followed, not led.

### Failure Modes

1. **Standards capture:** Industry pressure waters down criteria (the ESG problem)
2. **Credibility gap:** Can't recruit credible advisory board
3. **Chicken-and-egg:** Companies won't certify until it matters; doesn't matter until companies certify
4. **Gaming:** Companies optimize for certification without real change
5. **Funding gap:** Requires $500k-1M before revenue; foundation funding competitive
6. **Slow adoption:** 6-12 month certification timeline means slow growth

## AI-Enabled Capabilities: What's Newly Possible

This section details specific capabilities that make all three models viable with small teams.

### 1. Continuous Company Monitoring

**What it does:** Real-time tracking of 50+ companies' announcements, policy changes, and incidents

**How it works:**
- RSS feeds + AI summarization of company blogs, press releases
- Social media monitoring for executive statements, PR crises
- News aggregation with relevance filtering
- Job posting tracking for workforce signals
- Document change detection on company policy pages

**The old way:** Required a 5-person newsroom desk
**The new way:** One person + monitoring tools + AI summarization

**Tools:** Signal AI, Dataminr, custom RSS pipelines, Claude for summarization

### 2. "Commitment Drift" Detection

**What it does:** Automatically compares what companies promised vs. what they did

**How it works:**
- Archive company public commitments (AI safety pledges, policies, blog posts)
- Monitor for actions that contradict commitments
- Flag discrepancies for human review
- Track over time: is the company getting better or worse?

**Example:** Company pledged "no training on user data without consent" in 2023. Job posting in 2024 mentions "data pipeline for user conversation training." Flag for investigation.

**The old way:** Manual tracking in spreadsheets, easily missed
**The new way:** AI monitors + alerts on potential violations

### 3. Evidence-Based Rating Compilation

**What it does:** Compiles evidence against rating criteria from 10+ source types

**Sources:**
- SEC/public filings (governance, financials)
- Job postings (labor practices, capabilities)
- Glassdoor/Blind (employee sentiment)
- News coverage (incidents, reputation)
- Company policy documents (stated practices)
- Patent/paper filings (capability tracking)
- Social media (executive statements)
- Government contracts (deployment context)
- Litigation records (legal issues)
- Industry analyst reports (third-party assessments)

**The old way:** 2-3 analysts, 2 weeks per company
**The new way:** 1 person + AI, 2 days per company

### 4. Methodology as Code

**What it does:** Ensures rating consistency across 100+ company evaluations

**How it works:**
- Rating criteria codified into structured prompts
- AI applies criteria to evidence; human judges edge cases
- Version-controlled methodology
- Audit trail for every rating decision
- Consistent output regardless of which analyst runs it

**Benefits:**
- Reproducibility (others can verify your methodology)
- Scalability (one person, consistent output)
- Transparency (can explain every rating)

### 5. Multi-Source Intelligence

**What it does:** Synthesizes signals from unconventional sources

**Examples:**
- **Job posting analysis:** Company posting for "RLHF trainers in Kenya" signals labor practices
- **Glassdoor sentiment:** Employee reviews reveal internal culture
- **Patent filings:** Track capability development before public announcements
- **Conference presentations:** Extract claims from researcher talks
- **FOIA/public records:** Government correspondence with AI companies

**The old way:** Specialized departments for each source
**The new way:** AI synthesis from all sources simultaneously

## Synthesis: Which Model?

### Comparative Analysis

| Factor | Newsletter | Research Firm | Certification |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Time to revenue** | 3-6 months | 6-12 months | 12-18 months |
| **Capital required** | $0-50k | $100-300k | $500k-1M |
| **Impact on behavior** | LOW-MODERATE | MODERATE-HIGH | HIGH |
| **Credibility requirements** | Lower | Moderate | Higher |
| **Defensibility** | Low (anyone can start) | Moderate | High (first-mover) |
| **Scale ceiling** | $1-2M | $5-10M | $10M+ |

### Impact Potential Ranking

Based on research on how ratings/certifications actually change corporate behavior:

1. **Certification Body** - Creates direct market incentive; companies self-select
2. **Research Firm** - Influences procurement and investment decisions
3. **Newsletter** - Builds influence but limited direct behavior change

### The Sequencing Question

**Can you start with A and evolve to B or C?**

Yes, but with friction:

**Newsletter → Research Firm:**
- Requires pivot from individual voice to institutional research
- Audience may not follow (B2B vs B2C)
- But: reputation and methodology transfer

**Research Firm → Certification:**
- Natural evolution (ratings → standards → certification)
- Reputation transfers well
- Many certification bodies started as research orgs

**Newsletter → Certification:**
- Harder pivot; different audience, different value prop
- Individual voice ≠ institutional standards body
- Would essentially be starting over

### Recommendation

**If optimizing for IMPACT:** Start with Model B (Research Firm), with explicit plan to evolve toward Model C (Certification)

**Rationale:**
1. Research firm builds methodology, credibility, and database
2. Enterprise customers create financial incentive for companies to care
3. Certification is natural evolution once you're authoritative
4. Doesn't require $500k+ upfront (can bootstrap with existing research)

**If optimizing for SPEED TO REVENUE:** Start with Model A (Newsletter)

**Rationale:**
1. Fastest to launch, lowest capital
2. Tests audience interest before bigger investment
3. Builds personal brand that transfers to other models
4. But: may get stuck in "blogger" positioning

**If optimizing for LONG-TERM VALUE:** Start with Model C (Certification)

**Rationale:**
1. Highest defensibility and impact
2. Creates network effects and switching costs
3. But: requires foundation funding, advisory board, 18+ months before revenue
