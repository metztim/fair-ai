# Executive Synthesis: "Consumer Reports for AI"

## The Opportunity

You're considering launching an independent AI ethics ratings organization—"Consumer Reports for AI." After analyzing the market, comparable businesses, your founder fit, financial viability, and operational considerations, here's the verdict:

**CONDITIONAL GO.** The opportunity is real, the timing is right, and you can do this—but only with a specific transition strategy and clear success thresholds.

---

## Why This Works

**1. The Gap Is Real**
No one is doing comprehensive, consumer-facing AI ethics ratings. SaferAI and Stanford FMTI cover safety. Labor practices? Children's safety? Near-zero coverage. Certification seals like Fair Trade or B Corp for AI? Zero competitors.

**2. The Timing Is Now**
EU AI Act enforcement begins August 2025. Consumer demand is proven (84% want AI labeling). Enterprise procurement increasingly requires ethics due diligence. The window is opening—but won't stay open forever.

**3. The Business Model Exists**
Sacra (Walter Chen's company) proves a lean research team can reach sustainability in 18-30 months with $1M seed. Stratechery proves one person can build a $3M/year subscription business from Asia. You're not inventing a new model—you're applying proven ones to an underserved market.

**4. Outsiders Win Here**
GiveWell founders weren't philanthropy insiders. Consumer Reports wasn't founded by product engineers. Ben Thompson wasn't a journalist. The pattern is clear: rigorous methodology + independence + quality output beats credentials. Your outsider status is a feature, not a bug.

## Why This Could Fail

Being honest about risks:

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Revenue never reaches escape velocity ("Slow Death") | 30-40% | Consulting bridge; clear reversion triggers |
| Can't recruit credible advisors | 15-20% | Start with accessible tier; let quality output speak |
| First rating has methodological flaws | 20-25% | Extensive review; conservative first project |
| Dismissed as "just a marketer" | 25-30% | Advisory board; independence positioning |

**Overall probability of replacing $130k income within 24 months: 40-60%**

This is honest. Your Thailand location, consulting skills, and gradual transition strategy improve odds significantly versus a typical media startup.

## The Numbers

**Your Thailand Advantage**
- Monthly burn (family of 4): $6,000-7,500
- Equivalent US lifestyle: $12,000-15,000
- Your runway extends 2-2.5x versus US-based founders

**The Consulting Bridge**
- Your rate: $200/hour (validated)
- 10-15 hours/week = $8,000-12,000/month
- This alone nearly replaces your Animalz income

**Revenue Timeline (Realistic)**
- Month 6: $500-2,000/month (early subscribers)
- Month 12: $3,000-5,000/month (growing base)
- Month 18: $6,000-10,000/month (sustainable)
- Month 24: $10,000-15,000/month (income replaced)

## The Recommended Path

### Phase 0: Validate While Employed (Months 1-6)
**Goal:** Prove demand without financial risk

- Build newsletter to 2,000+ subscribers
- Get 25+ paid beta subscribers ($5,000 revenue proves willingness to pay)
- Line up 1-2 consulting clients ($3,000+/month)
- Save $50,000-90,000 additional runway
- Daily AI ethics Twitter/forum engagement
- 10-20 informational interviews with AI researchers

**Decision Point:** If you can't get 25 paid subscribers in 6 months, this isn't viable.

### Phase 1: Negotiated Transition (Months 7-12)
**Goal:** Reduce employment, scale venture

- Propose 60% time at Animalz (leverage Walter relationship)
- Consulting: $6,000/month
- Subscriptions: $2,000-4,000/month
- Combined income: ~$85-100k (manageable reduction)
- Secure 2-3 advisory board commitments
- Publish first pilot rating

**Reversion Trigger:** If combined revenue <$7,000/month for 2 consecutive months, return to full-time.

### Phase 2: Full Independence (Months 13-18)
**Goal:** Income replacement

- Consulting ($6,000/month) + Subscriptions ($4,000-8,000/month) = $10,000-14,000/month
- Exceeds previous income by Month 18-24
- Begin Research Director recruitment if scaling

**Critical Decision at Month 18:**
- Strong position (>$12k/month): Continue scaling
- Weak position (<$8k/month): Active job search

## Location Strategy

**Launch from Thailand. Don't relocate yet.**

Ben Thompson proved you can build massive influence from Asia. His 11-year run from Taiwan reached $3M/year revenue before he moved to the US in 2025. His reason for eventually moving: "Being on the opposite side of the world was definitely limiting"—but only after reaching a ceiling that required new formats.

**Your Hybrid Approach:**
- Base: Thailand (cost advantage, independence positioning)
- US presence: 3-4 strategic trips/year (key conferences, partner meetings)
- Team: Part-time US-based contractor when revenue supports it
- Legal: US 501(c)(3) with you as Thailand-based contractor

**Don't relocate while proving the model.** Thompson waited 11 years and $3M revenue.

## The Walter Chen Conversation

You have a unique asset: direct access to someone who's done this.

**Framing:** "I'm exploring a Sacra-like model for AI ethics—Consumer Reports meets Fair Trade for AI."

**What to Ask:**
1. Sacra's actual timeline to sustainability (not just public story)
2. Biggest operational surprises in year one
3. How did the EquityZen partnership come about?
4. Would he consider an advisory role?
5. If concept validates, interest in angel investment?

**What You Bring:**
- Content/audience skills (proven at Ahrefs, Animalz)
- AI workflow expertise (50+ production workflows)
- Independence (no AI industry conflicts)
- First-mover on multi-pillar certification

**Don't ask for funding yet.** Validation phase first.

## Before You Do Anything Else

**The Critical Conversation: Your Wife**

This plan requires family buy-in. Have this conversation before anything else:

1. Is she comfortable with 30-40% income reduction in Year 1?
2. What's the acceptable savings drawdown?
3. How long will she support the venture before reverting to employment?
4. What's the minimum income threshold for family security?

Without aligned expectations here, none of this works.

---

## Go/No-Go Checklist

**Must Have Before Any Transition:**
- [ ] $90,000+ cash runway
- [ ] 1-2 consulting clients ($3,000+/month validated)
- [ ] 25+ paid beta subscribers
- [ ] Wife's explicit buy-in on risk tolerance
- [ ] Walter Chen conversation completed
- [ ] 3-5 advisory board targets identified

**If All Boxes Checked by Month 6:** Proceed to Phase 1
**If Not:** Either extend validation or abandon

---

## The Bottom Line

This is viable but not without significant risk. The gradual transition with consulting bridge offers the best probability of success while managing downside.

The market gap is real. The timing is right. Your skills transfer. Your location is an advantage. The comparable business models work.

The question isn't "Can this work?" It's "Are you and your family willing to accept the 40-60% probability of success over 24 months?"

If yes: Start Phase 0 validation immediately while employed.
If no: Keep the full-time job and build this as a side project indefinitely.

Either path is legitimate. The worst outcome is the middle—half-committing, draining savings without hitting escape velocity, and ending up worse off than either alternative.

Choose your path. Execute with discipline. Set clear reversion triggers. And remember: the consulting bridge changes everything. You're not betting the farm—you're building a business with a safety net.
