# Guiding Principles

*Philosophical foundations for how this project should operate.*

## The Ego Test

Before publishing anything, ask:

> **"If this got zero engagement, would I still be glad I made it?"**

- If yes — it's service.
- If no — it's ego.

## Teaching, Not Selling

The distinction isn't promotion vs. no promotion. It's **motivation**.

| Ego-driven marketing | Service-driven sharing |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Look at me" | "Here's something useful" |
| Attached to metrics, praise | Detached from reception |
| Performative, signaling | Substantive, offering |
| Wants credit | Wants impact |

Publishing rigorous research and sharing it widely isn't self-promotion — it's the entire point. A report sitting unread on a server helps no one.

## The Work IS the Marketing

Make the work so valuable that sharing it is an act of service.

**Do this:**
- Publish findings openly
- Make research accessible
- Respond when journalists ask questions
- Share work in communities where it's relevant
- Let others take credit if it advances the cause

**Skip this:**
- Manufacturing controversy for attention
- Engagement-hacking ("hot takes" you don't believe)
- Metric obsession (follower counts as identity)
- Credit-claiming and self-congratulation

## Buddhist Execution Principles

### Right Motivation
Don't abandon true motivation to chase larger markets. If the genuine intent is reducing harm from AI, lead with that.

### Middle Way
The phased transition (consulting bridge, reversion triggers, gradual commitment) isn't timidity — it's wisdom. Reject both reckless leaps and paralyzed safety.

### Non-Attachment
Set the intention, do the work, release the outcome. Define clear kill switches. Non-attachment isn't giving up — it's not white-knuckling a failing path.

### Beginner's Mind
Independence from AI industry funding, Silicon Valley groupthink, and academic politics is a feature. Lead with independence, not credentials.

### Patience
Don't rush for speed. One rigorous, unassailable report builds more credibility than ten rushed ones.

## The Summary

Do the right thing, in the right way, and let go of whether it "works."
