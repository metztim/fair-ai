# Ines Lee Outreach Strategy

## Context

Dr. Ines Lee is an Oxford PhD economist who left academia to lead content for Ali Abdaal (6M+ YouTube subscribers). She now runs a portfolio career as a "fractional head of content/marketer/writer" while maintaining research affiliations at IFS, IZA, and CEPR. She explicitly states a "growing focus on AI progress and policy."

She writes thoughtfully critical pieces on AI—concerned about cognitive decline from over-reliance, content homogenization, and loss of original thinking. She advocates for using AI as enhancement, not replacement.

## Key Alignment

| Her Interests | Your Project |
|---------------|--------------|
| AI progress and policy | AI accountability research |
| Rigorous + accessible research | Open-source methodology, public-facing output |
| Public impact over academic prestige | Publishing freely, not gatekeeping |
| Portfolio/project-based work | Collaboration, not full-time commitment |
| T-shaped expertise (deep + broad) | Economics + AI + content intersection |

## Unique Angle for Ines

Two of your three articles directly match her research interests:
1. **Environmental impact (Haiku greener?)** → Overlaps with her economics training
2. **AI crawlers/robots.txt** → Copyright/data rights have policy implications she cares about

She might find the economic analysis of AI valuations less directly relevant to her work, but the methodology (rigorous research → public communication) is her exact specialty.

## What to Ask For

- 20-30 minute feedback call
- Her perspective on: research methodology, public communication of complex AI topics
- Gauge interest in collaboration (but don't lead with this)

## Draft Message

**Subject:** AI accountability research—would love your perspective

Hi Ines,

I've been following your writing on AI's cognitive impacts (the codependence piece really resonated). I'm working on something adjacent and would love your perspective.

Quick context: I'm building an open-source AI accountability project—transparent research on environmental impact, training data practices, and corporate claims that usually go unexamined. Think "Consumer Reports for AI" but pro-AI, pro-informed-decisions rather than anti-tech.

Three initial investigations:
1. Environmental comparison of AI models (should Haiku have a green icon?)
2. Which AI crawlers respect vs. ignore robots.txt
3. The economics of AI valuations vs. actual displacement

Given your background bridging rigorous research and public communication—and your growing focus on AI progress and policy—I'd really value your input on:
- Whether this framing resonates
- How you'd approach making this research accessible
- Holes you'd poke in the methodology

Would you be open to a 20-30 minute call? No ask beyond genuine feedback from someone whose work I respect.

## Alternative: Warmer/More Casual Version

**Subject:** Your AI codependence piece + a side project

Hi Ines,

Your piece on becoming codependent on AI has been living in my head. The "productive struggle" point especially—I've noticed the same in my own work.

I've been channeling that into a side project: open-source research on AI accountability. Environmental footprints, training data transparency, crawler behavior—the stuff companies claim but no one verifies.

Your work sits at the exact intersection of what I'm trying to do: rigorous research translated into accessible public communication. Would you be up for a quick call? I'd love to get your perspective.

## If She's Interested: Collaboration Angle

On the call, if she seems engaged, you could say something like:

"I don't have a specific ask beyond feedback, but I've been thinking about who might want to collaborate on something like this. You came to mind because of your research background and the way you translate complex topics. If this ever seems interesting as a project to work on together, I'd be open to that conversation—but no pressure, today is just about getting your input."

This opens the door without making her feel pitched.

## Follow-Up Strategy

If she responds positively:
1. Schedule call
2. Prepare brief overview: the vision, one investigation (probably environmental), methodology
3. Ask her questions about her AI policy interests
4. Listen for what excites her vs. what doesn't
5. After call: If strong signal, propose a small collaboration (co-author one article?)

## What NOT to Do

- Don't lead with "potential co-founder" (too much too soon)
- Don't over-formalize (she left academia partly to escape that)
- Don't downplay the rigor (she values methodology)
- Don't ignore her existing work—reference it specifically
- Don't send a one-pager upfront (save for follow-up if she asks)
