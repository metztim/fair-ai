# Walter Chen Outreach Strategy

## Context

Walter is the founder of both Animalz and Sacra. Sacra does exactly what AI Watchdog aspires to do—bring transparency to opaque markets through rigorous data + compelling narrative. He's an investor (17 companies through Golden Wok) who prioritizes founder relationships over transactional deals.

## Key Alignment

| His Values | Your Project |
|------------|--------------|
| Transparency in opaque markets | AI industry lacks accountability |
| Data + narrative methodology | Already have 52 sources, 12,700 lines of research |
| Content that creates genuine value | Open source, pro-informed-decisions stance |
| Ecosystem reinvestment | Publishing research freely |
| "Learn by doing" philosophy | Built methodology through actual investigation |

## What to Ask For

- 20-30 minute feedback call
- His perspective on: research business models, content → research firm evolution, market timing
- Not investment (at least not framed that way)

## Draft Message

**Subject:** Quick feedback on an AI transparency research project?

Hi Walter,

I've been working on a side project and realized I'm essentially building a version of Sacra for the AI industry—transparent research on an opaque market.

The core idea: AI companies make big claims (environmental impact, training data sources, labor practices) with no independent verification. I'm building open-source research and accountability frameworks—"Consumer Reports for AI" but with a pro-AI, pro-informed-decisions stance rather than anti-tech.

I've spent the past 6 weeks building the methodology—52 catalogued sources, detailed financial analysis, investigation frameworks. Three initial focus areas: AI valuations vs. displacement economics, environmental footprint comparisons, and crawler/robots.txt compliance.

Given you built the playbook with Sacra (data + narrative transparency for private markets), I'd really value your perspective on:
- Whether this is a viable research business or better as an open-source project
- How you'd approach the content → research firm evolution
- What holes you'd poke in the idea

Would you be open to a 20-30 minute call sometime in the next few weeks? No pitch deck, just a genuine conversation to get your input.

## Alternative: Shorter Version

**Subject:** Sacra for AI?

Hi Walter,

Quick question: if you were building Sacra today for a new opaque market, would you do anything differently?

I'm working on something similar for AI accountability—transparent research, open-source methodology, rigorous data + narrative. Been at it 6 weeks with solid progress.

Would love 20 mins of your brain if you're open to it. Not a pitch, just genuine feedback from someone who's done this.

## Follow-Up Strategy

If he responds positively:
1. Schedule call
2. Prepare 3-5 minute screen share of: README, research structure, one investigation (AI bubble)
3. Let him drive the conversation—he'll ask what he cares about
4. Take notes on his concerns/suggestions
5. After call: Send thank you + specific follow-up on whatever he was most interested in

## What NOT to Do

- Don't send a long one-pager upfront (feels like homework)
- Don't position as an investment opportunity (even if it could become one)
- Don't oversell—he values intellectual humility
- Don't hide the early stage—he invests in founders over products
