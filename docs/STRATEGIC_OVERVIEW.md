# AI Watchdog: Strategic Overview

> Master reference document for current project direction. Updated 2025-12-08.

## The Vision

**Open Source AI Accountability** — Transparent research on AI companies' claims, practices, and impacts. Pro-AI, pro-informed-decisions (not anti-tech).

Core principles:
- Radical transparency (everything on GitHub)
- Self-accountability (publish own token usage)
- Invitation over accusation ("here's what we found, help us improve")
- Research with Claude Code as methodology (new approach worth showcasing)

---

## Current Status

**Phase:** Pre-launch, content development
**Decision:** Finish first article before outreach

---

## Three Articles/Investigations

| # | Topic | Status | Description | Output |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **AI Bubble Valuation** | Draft v2 (~5k words, 52 sources) | "Let's Hope We're in an AI Bubble—The Alternative Is Worse" — Economic analysis of whether AI valuations make sense given displacement economics | Article |
| 2 | **Haiku Environmental** | Idea stage | Does using Haiku vs Opus have meaningful environmental impact? Should Anthropic show a "green" icon? | Article + Token tracking app |
| 3 | **AI Crawlers & robots.txt** | Idea stage | Which AI crawlers respect robots.txt? An index of crawler behavior and compliance | Article + Index/database |

All three fit the "pro-AI, pro-informed-decisions" positioning. They're transparency, not attacks.

## Outreach Plan

### Sequence

```
1. Finish AI bubble article ← CURRENT FOCUS
2. Publish (Substack/GitHub/Medium)
3. Reach out to Walter Chen
4. Reach out to Ines Lee
```

### Walter Chen

**Who:** Founder of Animalz & Sacra, investor (Golden Wok)
**Why:** Built Sacra doing exactly this (data + narrative on opaque markets)
**Ask:** 20-30 min feedback call, not investment
**Angle:** "You built the playbook. I'm doing something similar for AI accountability."
**Full strategy:** `docs/outreach/walter-chen-outreach.md`

### Ines Lee

**Who:** Oxford PhD economist, Head of Content for Ali Abdaal, AI policy writer
**Why:** Bridges rigorous research and public communication; explicitly focused on AI progress and policy
**Ask:** 20-30 min feedback call; gauge collaboration interest organically
**Angle:** "Your work on AI's cognitive impacts resonates. I'm building something adjacent."
**Full strategy:** `docs/outreach/ines-lee-outreach.md`
