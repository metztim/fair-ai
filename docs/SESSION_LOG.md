## Session Log: 2025-11-28

**Project**: ai-watchdog
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Type**: [research] [strategy]

### Objectives
- Clarify Research Firm model: who are the clients, why would they pay?
- Size the market: how many AI companies need to be covered?
- Validate demand: do enterprises actually care about AI ethics in procurement?

### Summary
Critical pivot in understanding. Enterprises DO care about AI ethics in procurement, but driven by **compliance/liability fear**, not moral values. This changes positioning from "ethics ratings" to "vendor risk assessment." Raises question of founder fit - compliance angle requires regulatory expertise Tim doesn't have.

### Files Changed
- `docs/research/10-company-universe.md` - Created: Market sizing (30-50 companies Year 1 viable)
- `docs/research/11-enterprise-demand-reality.md` - Created: Enterprise demand validation
- `README.md` - Created: Master project index for future sessions

### Key Findings

**Market Size:**
- 70,000+ AI companies globally
- **100-500 procurement-relevant**
- **30-50 viable Year 1 coverage** (exceeds SaferAI's 20, Stanford FMTI's 14)

**Enterprise Demand Reality:**
- 66% of procurement leaders say ESG/regulatory demands influence sourcing
- EU AI Act penalties: €35M or 7% revenue (enforcement Aug 2025)
- BUT: Ethics ranks only 17% vs 35% for operational benchmarks
- **Key insight: They care, but it's compliance-driven, not ethics-driven**

**The Positioning Dilemma:**

| Ethics Framing | Compliance Framing |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "AI ethics ratings" | "AI vendor risk assessment" |
| Better founder fit | Larger market |
| Journalism angle | GRC/audit angle |
| Can do solo | Needs regulatory expertise |

**Founder Fit Implications:**
- Compliance angle requires regulatory expertise (co-founder, advisor, or hire)
- Ethics angle better fits Tim's skills but smaller market
- Hybrid possible: start ethics, build toward compliance over time

### Open Decision

**The fork in the road:**
1. **Ethics/journalism** - Better fit, smaller market, can start solo
2. **Compliance** - Bigger market, needs regulatory co-founder/advisor
3. **Hybrid** - Start ethics, evolve toward compliance

### Files Consolidated
Moved loose research files into `docs/research/`:
- `10-company-universe.md` (was in root)
- `11-enterprise-demand-reality.md` (was in /research/)

### Research Package Final

12 documents, ~15,000+ lines:
- 00-11: Full research coverage from Sacra analysis through enterprise demand validation

### Next Actions
- [ ] **Decision required:** Ethics vs Compliance vs Hybrid positioning
- [ ] If compliance: Identify potential regulatory co-founders/advisors
- [ ] If ethics: Accept smaller market, proceed with Newsletter → Research Firm path
- [ ] Have Walter Chen conversation (framing depends on above decision)

### Session Continuation
```
"Continue AI watchdog project - read README.md and docs/SESSION_LOG.md for context."
```

## Session Log: 2025-11-27

**Project**: ai-watchdog
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Type**: [research] [docs]

### Objectives
- Create business-focused scenarios report (user feedback: existing docs overindexed on personal feasibility, not business substance)
- Analyze three distinct business MODELS (not just scale variations)
- Include forward-looking AI capabilities analysis

### Summary
Created comprehensive business scenarios report analyzing three distinct business models: Newsletter/Media, Research Firm (Sacra model), and Certification Body (B Corp/Fair Trade model). Each model evaluated on impact potential, with research into certification economics, AI-native operations, and how ratings actually change corporate behavior.

### Files Changed
- `docs/research/06-business-scenarios.md` - Created: 3 business models with day 0 → year 3 roadmaps, unit economics, impact analysis
- `docs/research/07-certification-economics.md` - Created: B Corp, Fair Trade, LEED revenue models and pricing
- `docs/research/08-ai-native-operations.md` - Created: AI productivity multipliers, case studies, workflows
- `docs/research/09-impact-mechanisms.md` - Created: How ratings/certifications change corporate behavior

### Key Findings

**Three Business Models:**

| Model | Impact | Year 3 Revenue | Team |
|-------|--------|----------------|------|
| Newsletter/Media | LOW-MODERATE | $300k-$1M | 1-3 |
| Research Firm | MODERATE-HIGH | $1-3M | 4-8 |
| Certification Body | HIGH | $2-5M | 8-15 |

**Impact Mechanisms (ranked by effectiveness):**
1. Enterprise procurement requirements (HIGHEST) - companies must certify to win contracts
2. Regulatory/legal liability (HIGH)
3. Investor pressure with coordination (HIGH)
4. Reputational risk (MODERATE-HIGH)
5. Consumer awareness (LOW alone)

**AI Leverage (2015 vs 2025):**
- One person with AI = two-person team without
- 3-person team in 2025 matches 20-person team in 2015 for this work
- Key capabilities: continuous monitoring, methodology-as-code, evidence compilation

**Certification Economics (B Corp reference):**
- 9,576 certified companies, ~$78.5M annual revenue
- Annual fees: $2,100-$47,250 based on revenue
- ~$8,200 revenue per certified company
- Only 33-40% of applicants achieve certification

**Recommendation:** Start with Research Firm model (Model B), with explicit plan to evolve toward Certification (Model C). Research firm builds methodology and credibility; certification is natural evolution.

## Session Log: 2025-11-26 (Continuation)

**Project**: ai-watchdog
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Type**: [research] [docs]

### Objectives
- Complete Area 4: Financial Viability & Transition research
- Complete Area 5: Location & Operational Analysis research

### Summary
Completed remaining 2 research areas. All 5 research areas now complete. Full research package supports **CONDITIONAL GO** verdict with recommended GRADUAL TRANSITION path.

### Files Changed
- `docs/research/04-financial-viability.md` - Created: Financial modeling, transition scenarios, anti-portfolio analysis (1,300+ lines)
- `docs/research/05-location-operations.md` - Created: Thailand location analysis, Ben Thompson case study, AI company response strategy (1,900+ lines)

### Key Findings

**Financial Viability (Area 4):**
- Thailand burn rate: $5,600-7,400/month (family of 4, mid-range schools)
- Thailand cost advantage: 50-65% cheaper than US → extends runway 2-2.5x
- Revenue timeline: 18-24 months realistic to income replacement
- Consulting bridge critical: $200/hr × 10-15 hrs/week = $8-12k/month
- **Recommended path: Gradual Transition** (validate while employed → negotiate reduced hours → full independence)
- Probability of income replacement within 24 months: 40-60%
- Most likely failure mode: "Slow Death" (side project limbo, 30-40% probability)

**Location & Operations (Area 5):**
- Ben Thompson proved remote viability: Built $3M/year Stratechery from Taiwan over 11 years
- Thompson's 2025 relocation reveals ceiling: "Being on opposite side of world was definitely limiting"
- **Recommendation: CONDITIONAL GO with Hybrid Strategy**
- Minimum US presence: 3-4 strategic trips/year, part-time US team member later
- Time zone advantage for methodical ratings work (write at night, publish as US wakes)
- Geographic independence positions well for credibility ("not in Silicon Valley's bubble")
- Legal structure: US 501(c)(3) with Tim as Thailand-based contractor

### Updated Verdict: CONFIRMED CONDITIONAL GO

**Recommended Transition Path:**
- Phase 0 (Months 0-6): Validate while employed at Animalz
- Phase 1 (Months 7-12): Negotiate 60% time at Animalz + consulting + subscriptions
- Phase 2 (Months 13-18): Full independence ($10k+/month combined income)

**Go/No-Go Thresholds:**
- Must have: $90k+ runway, 1-2 consulting clients ($3k+/month), 25+ paid subscribers, wife's buy-in
- Month 12 trigger: If <$7k/month for 2 consecutive months → return to full-time
- Month 18 decision: <$8k/month → active job search; >$12k/month → continue scaling

### Research Package Complete

| Area | Status | Document |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1. Sacra Model | ✅ | 01-sacra-analysis.md |
| 2. Founder Credibility | ✅ | 02-founder-credibility.md |
| 3. Competitive Landscape | ✅ | 03-competitive-landscape.md |
| 4. Financial Viability | ✅ | 04-financial-viability.md |
| 5. Location & Operations | ✅ | 05-location-operations.md |

**Total research: ~9,000+ lines across 5 documents**

### Next Actions (Updated)
- [x] Complete Area 4: Financial Viability research
- [x] Complete Area 5: Location & Operations research
- [x] Create executive synthesis document (00-executive-synthesis.md)
- [ ] Have Walter Chen conversation with concrete pitch
- [ ] Have financial conversation with wife (critical)
- [ ] Start daily AI ethics Twitter/forum engagement
- [ ] Draft advisory board target list (50+ names)
- [ ] Model personal financial transition scenarios with actual numbers

### Executive Synthesis Created

Created `docs/research/00-executive-synthesis.md` - a 3-page consultant-style deliverable containing:
1. The Opportunity (why this works)
2. Why This Could Fail (honest risks with probabilities)
3. The Numbers (Thailand advantage, consulting bridge, revenue timeline)
4. The Recommended Path (Phase 0 → 1 → 2 with milestones)
5. Location Strategy (launch from Thailand, don't relocate yet)
6. The Walter Chen Conversation (exact framing and asks)
7. The Critical Conversation (wife buy-in checklist)
8. Go/No-Go Checklist (concrete boxes to check)
9. The Bottom Line (40-60% probability framing)

**Key Reframe:** The consulting bridge ($200/hr × 10-15 hrs/week = $8-12k/month) means you're not "betting the farm"—you're building a business with a safety net.

### Research Phase Complete

All 5 research areas + executive synthesis complete. Total output: ~9,500+ lines across 6 documents.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| 00-executive-synthesis.md | 3-page actionable consultant report |
| 01-sacra-analysis.md | Business model comparable |
| 02-founder-credibility.md | Founder fit assessment |
| 03-competitive-landscape.md | Market gaps and timing |
| 04-financial-viability.md | Financial modeling |
| 05-location-operations.md | Thailand/location analysis |

- Daily AI ethics engagement
- 10-20 informational interviews
- Decision point: 25 paid subscribers or abandon

### Metrics (Final)
- Files created: 6 (5 research docs + 1 synthesis)
- Total research output: ~9,500+ lines
- Research areas completed: 5 of 5 + synthesis

## Session Log: 2025-11-26

**Project**: ai-watchdog
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Type**: [research] [docs]

### Objectives
- Analyze comprehensive research assignment for Consumer-Facing AI Ethics organization
- Execute priority research using subagents for depth and context efficiency
- Produce actionable findings and go/no-go recommendation

### Summary
Completed 3 of 5 planned research areas focusing on "deal-breaker" questions first: Sacra business model analysis, founder credibility assessment, and competitive landscape. Research supports a CONDITIONAL GO verdict. Preserved all findings in plan file and research documents before hitting context limits.

### Files Changed
- `docs/research/01-sacra-analysis.md` - Created: Comprehensive Sacra business model analysis (770 lines)
- `docs/research/02-founder-credibility.md` - Created: Founder fit assessment with pattern matching (1,734 lines)
- `docs/research/03-competitive-landscape.md` - Created: Market gaps, timing analysis, demand evidence (1,902 lines)
- `~/.claude/plans/crystalline-napping-reddy.md` - Created: Research execution plan with synthesis and recommendations

### Technical Notes
- Used `best-practices-researcher` subagent type for web research tasks
- Subagents manage their own context, allowing comprehensive research without main context bloat
- Plan file serves as context preservation mechanism between sessions
- User clarified framing: NOT "AI safety watchdog" but "Consumer Reports for AI" / "Fair Trade label for AI"
- Evolution path: Start with ratings → Add investigative journalism capacity later

### Key Findings

**Sacra Model:**
- $1M seed, 4-10 person team, 18-30 months to sustainability
- Pricing tiers: $500/yr → $3,500/yr → $15,000/yr
- Platform partnerships (EquityZen) key for distribution
- B2C harder than B2B (consumers expect free safety info)

**Founder Credibility:**
- Current rating: 3/5, potential 4/5 in 12-18 months
- Key insight: Successful watchdog founders were mostly OUTSIDERS
- Strengths: Content/Media (5/5), Track Record (4/5)
- Gaps: AI Ethics Network (1/5), Academic Credentials (1/5)

**Competitive Landscape:**
- CRITICAL GAP: No comprehensive multi-pillar consumer-facing ratings exist
- Safety pillar crowded; Labor and Children pillars nearly empty
- ZERO certification/seal programs exist
- Timing window OPENING (EU AI Act Aug 2025, 84% consumers want labeling)
- Revenue potential: $2.5-6M/year by Year 3

### Future Plans & Unimplemented Phases

#### Area 4: Financial Viability & Transition
**Status**: Not started
**Priority**: HIGH
**Planned Steps**:
1. Personal financial modeling against $130k current income
2. Model transition scenarios (gradual, negotiated, clean break, funded)
3. Revenue timeline reality check for media/research startups
4. Thailand cost-of-living advantage quantification
5. Consulting bridge viability assessment ($200/hr rate)
6. Anti-portfolio analysis - why this might NOT work, failure modes

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use Sacra findings to inform subscription economics
- Need to calculate: monthly burn, runway needed, break-even timeline
- Model go/no-go income thresholds

#### Area 5: Location & Operational Analysis
**Status**: Not started
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Planned Steps**:
1. Thailand as base: advantages/disadvantages for US-focused organization
2. Ben Thompson / Stratechery deep dive (built global influence from Taiwan)
3. Minimum US presence requirements (trips, events, regulatory engagement)
4. Timezone and distributed team considerations
5. AI company response strategy - how will companies react to negative ratings?

**Implementation Notes**:
- Research other successful remote-first media/research orgs
- Quantify travel requirements and costs

#### Pillar Framework Research
**Status**: Deferred to methodology development phase
**Priority**: LATER
**Candidate Pillars**:
- Current: Safety, Labor, Children, Governance, Societal Impact
- Missing candidates: IP/Copyright, Environment, Privacy/Data, Economic Practices, Accessibility
**Planned Steps**:
1. Research what dimensions existing frameworks cover (B Corp, ESG, etc.)
2. Survey what matters most to consumers
3. Finalize pillar structure

#### Final Synthesis
**Status**: Partial (included in plan file, needs expansion after Phase 2)
**Planned Deliverable**: `docs/research/00-executive-synthesis.md`
**Contents**:
