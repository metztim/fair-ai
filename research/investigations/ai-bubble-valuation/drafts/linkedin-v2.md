# LinkedIn Post Draft v2: "Let's Hope We're in an AI Bubble"

---

Everyone's calling this an AI bubble.

I hope they're right.

The numbers seem absurd: OpenAI valued at $500B with $20B in revenue. $1-1.5T in vendor deals. The math doesn't work.

But I'm seeing something different in my daily work with AI.

I can automate at least 25% of work at most companies I've advised. In some cases, over 50%.

This isn't the creative work — that's still complicated. But admin, finance, operations, project management? With today's publicly available models, 80-90% of that work can be automated.

For my own side project, Claude Code writes the code, tests the UX by using Chrome, and manages its own task list on a Notion board.

My role is basically orchestrator.

This is what's publicly released. Right now.

Most people aren't seeing what I'm seeing yet. I estimate I'm 12-24 months ahead of the average knowledge worker in AI usage. The AI companies themselves are likely another 12-24 months ahead of me with their internal models.

That's a 2-4 year perception gap.

Between what the public thinks AI can do and what's actually possible.

OpenAI's revenue jumped from $13B to $20B ARR in just four months — a 54% increase. To people judging based on 2023 capabilities, that looks absurd. But if you're experiencing what these tools can do today, that growth makes sense.

The USA spends roughly $4T annually on knowledge worker salaries.

If these companies can see — with models that are 12-24 months ahead of public release — that they can capture even a fraction of that market, then these valuations aren't hype.

They're pricing the alternative to the bubble: massive labor displacement.

And that's why I hope everyone calling this a bubble is right.

Because we know how bubbles end. They're painful but familiar. We've been through them before.

The alternative — widespread job displacement with no plan for what comes next — is a future we've never navigated.

Not at this scale, not at this speed.

So yes, let's hope it's a bubble.

Are the economics proof of a bubble, or are we mispricing what's actually coming?
