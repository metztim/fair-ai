# LinkedIn Post Draft: "Let's Hope We're in an AI Bubble"

---

Everyone's calling this an AI bubble. I hope they're right.

The numbers seem absurd: OpenAI valued at $500B with $20B in revenue. $1-1.5T in vendor deals. The math doesn't work.

Except here's what I'm seeing from my daily work with AI:

I can automate at least 25% of work at most companies I've advised. In some cases, over 50%. This isn't about the creative work—that's still complicated. But admin, finance, operations, project management? With today's publicly available models, 80-90% of that work can be automated.

For my own side project, Claude Code now writes the code, tests the UX by using Chrome, and manages its own task list on a Notion board. My role is basically orchestrator.

This is what's publicly released. Right now.

Here's the uncomfortable part: most people aren't seeing what I'm seeing yet. I estimate I'm 12-24 months ahead of the average knowledge worker in AI usage. The AI companies themselves are likely another 12-24 months ahead of me with their internal models.

That's a 2-4 year perception gap between what the public thinks AI can do and what's actually possible.

Which explains OpenAI's explosive growth—revenue jumped from $13B to $20B ARR in just four months. To people judging based on 2023 capabilities, that looks absurd. But if you're experiencing what these tools can do today, that growth makes sense.

The USA spends roughly $4T annually on knowledge worker salaries. If these companies can see—with models that are 12-24 months ahead of public release—that they can capture even a fraction of that market, then these valuations aren't hype.

They're pricing the alternative to the bubble: massive labor displacement.

And that's why I hope everyone calling this a bubble is right.

Because we know how bubbles end. They're painful but familiar. We've been through them before.

The alternative—widespread job displacement with no plan for what comes next—is a future we've never navigated. Not at this scale, not at this speed.

So yes, let's hope it's a bubble.

What do you think? Are the economics proof of a bubble, or are we mispricing what's actually coming?
