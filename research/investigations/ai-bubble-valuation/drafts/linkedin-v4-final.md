# LinkedIn Post Final v4: "Let's Hope We're in an AI Bubble"

---

Everyone's calling this an AI bubble.

I hope they're right. The alternative is worse.

The numbers seem absurd: OpenAI valued at $500B with $20B in revenue. $1-1.5T in vendor deals. Classic bubble metrics.

But what if it's not a bubble? What if these valuations are pricing something else: massive impending labor displacement?

For one of my side projects, Claude Code now writes the code, tests and improves the UX by itself using Chrome, and manages its own task list and priorities on a Notion board. My role is orchestrator at best.

This is based on what's publicly released. Right now.

These kinds of capabilities can automate at least 25% of work at most companies. In some cases, over 50%. Lots of tasks in admin, finance, operations, (project) management, etc.

Let's say I'm 12-24 months ahead of the average knowledge worker in AI usage. The AI companies themselves are likely another 12-24 months ahead of me with their internal models and R&D.

That's a two to four year perception gap between what the public (incl. most experts and journalists) thinks AI can do and what's actually possible.

The USA spends roughly $4T annually on knowledge worker salaries.

If these companies can see -- with models that are 12-24 months ahead of public release -- that they can capture even a fraction of that market pretty soon, then these valuations aren't hype.

They're pricing the shift from white-collar jobs to data centers.

We know how bubbles end. They're painful but familiar. We've been through them before. They have benefits in the long run.

The alternative -- widespread job displacement with no plan for how to handle it -- is a much scarier future.

So yes, let's hope it's a bubble.
