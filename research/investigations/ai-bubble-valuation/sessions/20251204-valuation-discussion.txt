bble/20251204 lets-hope-were-in-an-ai-bubble-the-alternative-is-worse.md' is
 the latest draft of an article I'm working on, and I want to zoom in on the
 section: The Math of Massive Displacement

I need to come up with a way of calculating and projecting if my thesis 
holds up. Even if 25% of knowledge work by AI will be replaced in the coming
 2-4 years, does that warrant the current valuations of all the companies 
involved in building the technology and infrastructure that will facilitate 
that replacement? I'm not really sure to be honest how to even approach 
that. Can we brainstorm this together to see if we can come up with a 
methodology and/or calculation that would achieve this?

Feel free to launch subagents to do web research and/or research on my 
materials to come up with some ideas. Also feel free to ask me follow-up 
questions. 

⏺ I'll read your draft first to understand your current thesis, then launch
  some research to gather data for this calculation. Let me do both in
  parallel.

⏺ I've read your article and gathered extensive research. This is a
  fascinating challenge because you're essentially trying to answer: "If AI 
  replaces X% of knowledge work, does the math support Y trillion in 
  valuations?"

  Let me synthesize what I found and propose some frameworks.

  Key Data Points

  AI Valuations (late 2024/2025):
  - Total market value added since ChatGPT: ~$19 trillion
  - OpenAI: $500B valuation, ~$4B revenue, losing $5B/year
  - Anthropic: $350B valuation, ~$1B revenue, losing $5B/year
  - Nvidia: $4.4T market cap (but 30x P/E — justified by $130B actual
  revenue)
  - Hyperscaler CapEx: $241B (2024), guidance $300-380B (2025)

  Knowledge Work Market:
  - US knowledge worker wages: $10-11 trillion annually
  - Global: $50-70 trillion annually
  - ~100 million US knowledge workers

  McKinsey's estimates:
  - 30% of US work hours could be automated by 2030
  - AI could inject $2.6-4.4T annually in economic value globally

  The Core Challenge

  The hard question isn't "how much work can AI do?" — it's "who captures 
  the value?"

  When 25% of knowledge work gets automated, that $2.75T (25% of $11T US
  wages) doesn't all flow to AI companies. It gets distributed among:
  1. Infrastructure providers (Nvidia, data centers)
  2. Model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
  3. Application builders (vertical SaaS, enterprise tools)
  4. Employers (retained as profit)
  5. Consumers (lower prices)
  6. Workers (some wage increases for remaining workers)

  Potential Calculation Approaches

  Approach 1: Value Capture Ratio
  Question: What % of displaced labor value do AI companies need to capture
  to justify valuations?

  $19T in market cap gains since ChatGPT
  $2.75T/year in US labor displacement (25% of $11T)

  If AI companies capture 10% of that annually = $275B/year
  At a 20x revenue multiple = $5.5T justified valuation
  At a 30x multiple = $8.25T justified valuation

  Current valuations: ~$19T
  Required capture rate for justification: ~20-30% of displaced labor value

  Approach 2: Infrastructure vs. Margin Layer
  Nvidia captures ~$130B/year (real revenue from AI chips). The
  model/application layers (OpenAI, Anthropic) are burning cash. Maybe the
  question is whether the infrastructure valuations are justified even if
  the application layer is a bubble.

  Approach 3: Historical Automation Precedent
  Research shows productivity gains from automation are distributed roughly:
  - Labor: ~20-30% (wage increases for remaining workers)
  - Capital/employers: ~40-50%
  - Technology providers: ~10-20%
  - Consumers: ~10-20%

  If AI providers capture 15% of $2.75T = ~$412B annually

  Approach 4: Discounted Cash Flow
  If displacement ramps up over 4 years:
  Year 1: 5% → $550B labor value displaced
  Year 2: 10% → $1.1T
  Year 3: 20% → $2.2T
  Year 4: 25% → $2.75T

  Total 4-year displaced value: ~$6.6T
  AI company capture @ 15%: ~$1T cumulative
  NPV @ 10% discount rate: ~$800B

  Current AI company valuations: $850B+ (OpenAI + Anthropic + others)

  Questions for You

  Before we nail down a methodology, some clarifying questions:

  1. Scope: Do you want to focus on US knowledge work ($11T) or global
  ($50-70T)? Your article seems US-focused but your thesis is broader.
  2. Which valuations: Are we trying to justify:
    - The model providers specifically (OpenAI $500B, Anthropic $350B)?
    - The entire AI infrastructure ecosystem ($19T in gains)?
    - Just the "bubble" portion (companies without earnings)?
  3. Time horizon: Your thesis is 2-4 years. But markets price in 10-20 year
   time horizons. Should the calculation assume this is just the beginning
  of a longer displacement curve?
  4. Capture mechanism: What's your intuition on how AI companies monetize
  this? Is it:
    - Subscription revenue (like now)?
    - Per-task pricing (Altman's $2K/month agent)?
    - Something else?

  The answer to these shapes whether we calculate a single number, a range,
  or a scenario analysis.
