# Session Log: 2025-12-05 - Valuation Methodology

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Type:** [research] [analysis] [methodology]

---

## Session Objectives

1. Develop methodology for validating AI bubble valuation thesis
2. Calculate whether 25% knowledge work displacement justifies current valuations
3. Research what happens if AI companies go bankrupt (IP survival)
4. Understand bubble pop → acceleration dynamic

---

## Key Questions Explored

### Primary Question
> If 25% of knowledge work is displaced by AI in 2-4 years, do current AI valuations make sense?

### Sub-Questions
1. What is the total addressable market (knowledge work wages)?
2. What capture rate do AI companies need to justify valuations?
3. What happens to AI technology if companies go bankrupt?
4. Does a bubble pop accelerate or slow displacement?

## Methodology Developed

### Value Capture Framework

**Step 1: Define the value pool**
- Global knowledge worker wages: $50-70 trillion/year
- US knowledge worker wages: $10-11 trillion/year
- 25% displacement = $12.5-17.5T globally / $2.75T US

**Step 2: Estimate capture rates**
Historical automation research suggests:
- Employers: 40-50% (retained profit)
- Consumers: 15-25% (lower prices)
- Workers: 10-20% (wage gains for remaining)
- Technology providers: 10-20%

**Step 3: Calculate required capture**
- Current AI market cap gains since ChatGPT: ~$19 trillion
- At 20x revenue multiple: $950B annual revenue needed
- At 30x multiple: $633B annual revenue needed
- Required capture rate: 5-10% of displaced labor value

**Step 4: Timeline sensitivity**
- Current AI revenue: $100-150B/year
- At 3x annual growth trajectory:
  - 2025: $150B
  - 2026: $450B
  - 2027: $1.35T → Exceeds justification threshold

## Key Findings

### 1. IP Survives Bankruptcy
- Microsoft owns 27% of OpenAI + IP rights through 2032
- Section 365(n) protects IP licensees in bankruptcy
- Nortel precedent: Patents sold for $4.5B, technology continued
- Implication: Even if OpenAI/Anthropic fail, technology persists

### 2. Bubble Pop = Acceleration
Historical evidence:
- Dot-com: Internet adoption accelerated after 2000 crash
- 2008: Automation investments increased during recession
- Mechanism: Stranded infrastructure becomes cheap, cost pressure forces efficiency

### 3. The Core Thesis
**Displacement is the constant; the bubble is just timing.**

Both scenarios lead to displacement:
- Bull case: Valuations justified, companies capture value from displacement
- Bear case: Bubble pops, infrastructure becomes cheaper, displacement accelerates

## Open Questions for Future Sessions

1. What specific roles face highest near-term automation risk?
2. How do regulatory responses (EU AI Act) affect timeline?
3. What's the DeepSeek/open-source disruption risk?
4. Energy constraints on AI scaling?

## Next Actions

- [ ] Draft "Math of Massive Displacement" section for article
- [ ] Create value capture visualization
- [ ] Research regulatory timeline (EU AI Act, US policy)
- [ ] Interview knowledge workers on AI workflow adoption
