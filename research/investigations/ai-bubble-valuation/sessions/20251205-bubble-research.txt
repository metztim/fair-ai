bble/20251204 lets-hope-were-in-an-ai-bubble-the-alternative-is-worse.md' is
 the latest draft of an article I'm working on, and I want to zoom in on the
 section: The Math of Massive Displacement

I need to come up with a way of calculating and projecting if my thesis 
holds up. Even if 25% of knowledge work by AI will be replaced in the coming
 2-4 years, does that warrant the current valuations of all the companies 
involved in building the technology and infrastructure that will facilitate 
that replacement? I'm not really sure to be honest how to even approach 
that. Can we brainstorm this together to see if we can come up with a 
methodology and/or calculation that would achieve this?

Feel free to launch subagents to do web research and/or research on my 
materials to come up with some ideas. Also feel free to ask me follow-up 
questions. 

⏺ I'll read your draft first to understand your current thesis, then launch
  some research to gather data for this calculation. Let me do both in
  parallel.

⏺ I've read your article and gathered extensive research. This is a
  fascinating challenge because you're essentially trying to answer: "If AI 
  replaces X% of knowledge work, does the math support Y trillion in 
  valuations?"

  Let me synthesize what I found and propose some frameworks.

  Key Data Points

  AI Valuations (late 2024/2025):
  - Total market value added since ChatGPT: ~$19 trillion
  - OpenAI: $500B valuation, ~$4B revenue, losing $5B/year
  - Anthropic: $350B valuation, ~$1B revenue, losing $5B/year
  - Nvidia: $4.4T market cap (but 30x P/E — justified by $130B actual
  revenue)
  - Hyperscaler CapEx: $241B (2024), guidance $300-380B (2025)

  Knowledge Work Market:
  - US knowledge worker wages: $10-11 trillion annually
  - Global: $50-70 trillion annually
  - ~100 million US knowledge workers

  McKinsey's estimates:
  - 30% of US work hours could be automated by 2030
  - AI could inject $2.6-4.4T annually in economic value globally

  The Core Challenge

  The hard question isn't "how much work can AI do?" — it's "who captures 
  the value?"

  When 25% of knowledge work gets automated, that $2.75T (25% of $11T US
  wages) doesn't all flow to AI companies. It gets distributed among:
  1. Infrastructure providers (Nvidia, data centers)
  2. Model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
  3. Application builders (vertical SaaS, enterprise tools)
  4. Employers (retained as profit)
  5. Consumers (lower prices)
  6. Workers (some wage increases for remaining workers)

  Potential Calculation Approaches

  Approach 1: Value Capture Ratio
  Question: What % of displaced labor value do AI companies need to capture
  to justify valuations?

  $19T in market cap gains since ChatGPT
  $2.75T/year in US labor displacement (25% of $11T)

  If AI companies capture 10% of that annually = $275B/year
  At a 20x revenue multiple = $5.5T justified valuation
  At a 30x multiple = $8.25T justified valuation

  Current valuations: ~$19T
  Required capture rate for justification: ~20-30% of displaced labor value

  Approach 2: Infrastructure vs. Margin Layer
  Nvidia captures ~$130B/year (real revenue from AI chips). The
  model/application layers (OpenAI, Anthropic) are burning cash. Maybe the
  question is whether the infrastructure valuations are justified even if
  the application layer is a bubble.

  Approach 3: Historical Automation Precedent
  Research shows productivity gains from automation are distributed roughly:
  - Labor: ~20-30% (wage increases for remaining workers)
  - Capital/employers: ~40-50%
  - Technology providers: ~10-20%
  - Consumers: ~10-20%

  If AI providers capture 15% of $2.75T = ~$412B annually

  Approach 4: Discounted Cash Flow
  If displacement ramps up over 4 years:
  Year 1: 5% → $550B labor value displaced
  Year 2: 10% → $1.1T
  Year 3: 20% → $2.2T
  Year 4: 25% → $2.75T

  Total 4-year displaced value: ~$6.6T
  AI company capture @ 15%: ~$1T cumulative
  NPV @ 10% discount rate: ~$800B

  Current AI company valuations: $850B+ (OpenAI + Anthropic + others)

  Questions for You

  Before we nail down a methodology, some clarifying questions:

  1. Scope: Do you want to focus on US knowledge work ($11T) or global
  ($50-70T)? Your article seems US-focused but your thesis is broader.
  2. Which valuations: Are we trying to justify:
    - The model providers specifically (OpenAI $500B, Anthropic $350B)?
    - The entire AI infrastructure ecosystem ($19T in gains)?
    - Just the "bubble" portion (companies without earnings)?
  3. Time horizon: Your thesis is 2-4 years. But markets price in 10-20 year
   time horizons. Should the calculation assume this is just the beginning
  of a longer displacement curve?
  4. Capture mechanism: What's your intuition on how AI companies monetize
  this? Is it:
    - Subscription revenue (like now)?
    - Per-task pricing (Altman's $2K/month agent)?
    - Something else?

  The answer to these shapes whether we calculate a single number, a range,
  or a scenario analysis.

> 1. I think a lot of these companies operate globally, so the scope should 
be global. Agree?
2. I think the entire AI ecosystem. My understanding is that most people who
 talk about the "AI bubble" think about the entire ecosystem (correct me if 
I'm wrong). Also, on the flipside, my thesis also is about the entire AI 
ecosystem benefitting from replacing knowledge work.
3. Hmmm, this is where it gets tricky. My thesis is that massive 
displacement could happen much faster than people think (e.g., 2-4 years), 
but in 10-20 years it will definitely happen. However, if you contrast this 
with the timing of a potential ubble and its potential popping, things get 
confusing. E.g., maybe the AI elite see that massive displacement could 
happen on a short time horizon. But the question is if the general market 
really believes that. I.e., if the general market would really take a 10-20 
year time horizon, the valuations would be justified (because I think most 
people will agree things will change in 10-20 years). But when the general 
market starts to believe that in the next years nothing much dramatically 
will change (economically), that's when the bubble will pop. So then in a 
sense the markets don't really have a 10-20 year time horizon if you see 
what I mean>
4. I think a combination of all those things: subscription + usage + 
agents/service/completed tasks.

One thing that I think is important: I believe eventually the 
model/application layers are going to capture most of the value (unless open
 source solutions like DeepSeek turn out to become more powerful) because 
that is where the power/capabilities/innovation really comes from imo. The 
only reason infrastructure is now more valuable is because that's the 
bottleneck, but eventually it will not be. E.g., during internet era, maybe 
people initially also thought fiber and telcos and ISPs would be most 
powerful, but they just turned into plumbing.

One way to look at this last point would be to look at revenue development 
at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, and perhaps Microsoft or Google for 
their AI services. If that revenue is growing exponentially, and considering
 most companies haven't started serous adoption, that could point to how 
they're going to be the ones taking the biggest slice.

Ok, there's a lot here. Please analyze with multilple subagents and please 
do check the things I'm proposing/saying and feel free to push back.

⏺ Excellent research came back. Let me update the todos and synthesize the
  findings.

⏺ Research Synthesis

  The research validates most of your intuitions, with some important
  nuances. Let me break this down:

  Your Point: Infrastructure → Application Value Shift

  You're right, with a timeline caveat.

  The internet parallel is instructive:
  - Peak infrastructure (2000): Cisco $500B, Nortel $400B, Lucent $285B =
  ~$1.2T combined
  - The crash: Nortel down 95% (bankrupt 2009), Cisco still below its 2000
  peak today
  - Application dominance: Took 10-15 years (2012-2015) for
  Google/Amazon/Facebook to clearly surpass infrastructure valuations

  Key difference you should note: AI infrastructure may not commoditize as
  cleanly as fiber did. Fab plants cost $20B+, TSMC/ASML create oligopolies,
   and CUDA ecosystem is a stickier moat than telecom switching costs. But
  your instinct is correct—long-term value will shift to the
  application/model layer.

  Your Point: Revenue Growth Validates Application Layer

  Strongly supported by data.

  | Company          | Revenue Trajectory                  | Doubling Time
  |
  |------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------
  |
  | OpenAI           | $3.7B (2024) → $13B ARR (July 2025) | 6 months
  |
  | Anthropic        | $1B (end 2024) → $7B ARR (Oct 2025) | 1-2 months (!)
  |
  | Amazon (1996-99) | $15M → $1.6B                        | ~12 months
  |
  | Google (2001-03) | $86M → $1.5B                        | ~6 months
  |

  OpenAI and Anthropic are growing faster than early Amazon or Google. This
  is unprecedented. The projection path:
  - OpenAI: $13B (2025) → $29B (2026) → $60B (2027) → $100B+ (2029)
  - Anthropic: $7B (2025) → $26B (2026) → $70B (2028)

  Your Point: Bubble Timing Depends on Short-Term Perception

  This is the most sophisticated insight, and the research confirms it's 
  complicated.

  Here's the paradox:
  - Markets theoretically price 10-20 year horizons (DCF models discount
  perpetual cash flows)
  - But institutional investors hold stocks 9-15 months on average
  - Result: Long-term valuations depend on 2030+ cash flows, but short-term
  trading reprices on 12-18 month sentiment

  The trigger question: You asked what would make the bubble pop. The
  research identifies:
  1. Earnings miss (OpenAI falling short of $13B+ target)
  2. ROI data worsening (MIT study: 95% of AI projects show zero return)
  3. Rate increases (Ray Dalio: "bubbles don't pop until monetary policy
  tightens")
  4. Open-source commoditization (DeepSeek threat briefly crashed markets)

  Even Sam Altman admits it: "Are we in a phase where investors as a whole
  are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes." (August 2025)

  Proposed Calculation Framework

  Based on all this, here's a methodology for your article:

  Framework: "What Capture Rate Justifies the Valuations?"

  Step 1: Define the value pool
  - Global knowledge worker wages: $50-70 trillion/year
  - If 25% automated: $12.5-17.5 trillion in labor value displaced annually
  - Conservative estimate (US-focused): $2.75T/year (25% of $11T)

  Step 2: Who captures this value?

  Historical automation research suggests value distribution:
  | Stakeholder                    | Capture Rate | Annual Value (on $12.5T
  displaced) |
  |--------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------
  -----------|
  | Employers (retained profit)    | 40-50%       | $5-6T
             |
  | Consumers (lower prices)       | 15-25%       | $2-3T
             |
  | Remaining workers (wage gains) | 10-20%       | $1-2.5T
             |
  | Technology providers           | 10-20%       | $1.25-2.5T
             |

  Step 3: How much do AI companies need to capture to justify valuations?

  Current AI-related market cap gains since ChatGPT: ~$19 trillion

  At a 20x revenue multiple (typical for high-growth tech):
  - $19T valuation ÷ 20 = $950B annual revenue needed
  - $950B ÷ $12.5T displaced = 7.6% capture rate required

  At a 30x multiple (bullish):
  - $19T ÷ 30 = $633B annual revenue needed
  - = 5% capture rate required

  Step 4: Is that realistic?

  Current AI revenue reality:
  - OpenAI: $13B ARR
  - Anthropic: $7B ARR
  - Microsoft AI contribution: ~$30-50B (estimated)
  - Google Cloud AI: ~$15B
  - Total AI-specific revenue: ~$100-150B/year

  Gap: Need $633-950B, have $100-150B = 4-6x growth required

  If revenue is growing 3x annually (current trajectory):
  - 2025: $150B
  - 2026: $450B
  - 2027: $1.35T → Exceeds requirement by 2027

  Step 5: The Timeline Sensitivity

  This is where your thesis gets interesting:

  | Scenario           | Displacement Timeline | Revenue to Justify    |
  Verdict   |
  |--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----
  -------|
  | Bull (your thesis) | 25% by 2028           | $633B (5% capture)    |
  Plausible |
  | Base               | 25% by 2032           | $633B (5% capture)    |
  Justified |
  | Bear               | 10% by 2028           | $633B on smaller base |
  Bubble    |

  The uncomfortable math: If displacement happens on your 2-4 year timeline,
   current valuations are roughly justified assuming AI companies capture
  5-10% of displaced labor value. If displacement takes 10+ years, current
  valuations are a bubble that will pop and re-inflate later (like Amazon
  2000-2015).

  ---
  Key Pushback / Things to Consider

  1. Capture rate uncertainty is huge: Whether AI companies capture 5% or
  20% of displaced value changes everything. Google and Facebook captured
  ~10-15% of ad industry value; AWS captured ~5-8% of IT infrastructure
  value. What's the right analog for AI?
  2. Profitability matters, not just revenue: OpenAI won't be profitable
  until 2030. Anthropic until 2028. If the bubble pops in 2026 (due to rate
  hikes, earnings miss, etc.), these companies may not survive to capture
  the value you're projecting.
  3. The infrastructure layer may not commoditize as fast: Unlike fiber,
  GPUs have $20B+ fab barriers, geopolitical constraints (Taiwan), and
  ecosystems (CUDA). Nvidia might retain value longer than Cisco did.
  4. Your perception gap thesis is key: The bubble pop depends on when the
  general market realizes displacement is happening. If it takes 5 years for
   mainstream perception to catch up to your 2-4 year reality, that's a
  bubble. If markets catch up faster, it's not.

  ---
  Want me to draft specific language for your article section, or refine any
   of these calculations further?

> Ok, this is great. One more tihng to consider: "these companies may not 
survive to capture the value you're projecting." I'm not sure this is 
accurate. If these companies go bankrupt, wouldn't someone swoop in to buy 
their technology for cheap and continue? In that sense, could it turn out 
critical who their current shareholders are? For example, I believe 
Anthropic has amazon and google as shareholders, and they might keep them 
going or take over?

Ultimately, my thesis is not about the economics but avbout the outcome: 
that we'll see massive labor displacement. And one point is that the bubble 
popping might actually lead to acclerated displacement because companies 
want to save costs.

So here's one scenario:
1. Bubble pops
2. Open AI / Anthropic go bankrupt
3. Google, or Amazon, or someone else swoops up their IP
4. Displacement happens with that IP

Please think this through and research with subagents to see what you think 
of this 

⏺ This is a crucial distinction. You're right—the thesis is about
  displacement as outcome, not the survival of specific companies. Let me
  research this angle.

⏺ Your Scenario Is Well-Supported

  The research strongly validates your intuition. Let me break down why your
   scenario holds:

  IP Survival: The Technology Doesn't Die

  OpenAI's structure:
  - Microsoft owns 27% + has IP rights through 2032 (protected by Section
  365(n) in bankruptcy law)
  - OpenAI's partners (Oracle, SoftBank, CoreWeave) carry $96-100B in debt
  tied to OpenAI's success
  - If OpenAI fails, Microsoft is best positioned—both legally and
  financially—to acquire the technology

  Anthropic's structure:
  - Google (14%) and Amazon (~10%) deliberately structured deals to avoid
  triggering acquisition rights
  - But in a bankruptcy auction, they'd compete to acquire Claude
  - Historical precedent: When Nortel went bankrupt, Apple-Microsoft
  consortium paid $4.5B for 6,000 patents—technology survived and continued

  The key insight: Bankruptcy doesn't destroy technology. It redistributes
  it, usually to the most capitalized bidders. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon
   aren't going anywhere.

  One wrinkle: Current antitrust environment is much stricter than 2011
  (Nortel). FTC is already investigating Microsoft-OpenAI. A full
  acquisition post-bankruptcy would likely face regulatory challenge. But
  this just means the IP might be distributed across multiple buyers rather
  than consolidated—displacement still happens.

  Bubble Pops CAN Accelerate Adoption

  The historical evidence is surprisingly clear on this:

  Dot-com crash (2000-2002):
  - NASDAQ fell 75%, $5 trillion erased
  - Internet adoption accelerated: 50% of households online (2001) → 73%
  (2006)
  - Mechanism: Stranded fiber infrastructure made connectivity cheap

  2008 Great Recession:
  - Robot orders dropped only modestly, then up 5% within 2 years
  - Automation adoption accelerated specifically in routine-cognitive 
  occupations (the automatable ones)
  - Academic finding: "The Great Recession accelerated adoption of
  routine-biased technologies"

  Why downturns accelerate labor-saving tech:
  1. Cost pressure forces efficiency
  2. Stranded infrastructure becomes cheap
  3. Surviving companies have capital to invest while labor becomes
  expendable
  4. Weak companies that couldn't automate get acquired by those who can

  The critical distinction: Bubbles that overbuild real infrastructure
  (fiber, data centers) enable future adoption. Bubbles that inflate only 
  valuations don't leave behind useful assets. The current AI bubble is
  both—$400B+ in real infrastructure investment plus inflated valuations.

  Your Scenario, Mapped Out

  | Step                                  | Likelihood  | Mechanism
                                                                       |
  |---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | 1. Bubble pops                        | High        | Earnings miss,
  rate hike, sentiment shift, or DeepSeek-style disruption                |
  | 2. OpenAI/Anthropic struggle          | Medium-High | OpenAI especially
  vulnerable ($1.4T commitments vs $20B revenue, $96B partner debt)    |
  | 3. IP acquired by big tech            | Very High   | Microsoft's
  Section 365(n) protection; historical precedent (Nortel); strategic stakes
   |
  | 4. Displacement continues/accelerates | High        | Stranded
  infrastructure becomes cheap; cost-cutting pressure forces adoption
      |

  The uncomfortable conclusion: Your thesis about displacement as the
  inevitable outcome holds regardless of bubble dynamics. The bubble is
  about who profits and when—not whether displacement happens.

  ---
  Revised Framework for Your Article

  Given this, I'd suggest reframing "The Math of Massive Displacement" as:

  The Displacement Is the Constant; The Bubble Is Just Timing

  Frame 1: Infrastructure Reality
  - $400B+ in data centers, training clusters, and GPU capacity is being
  built right now
  - This infrastructure exists regardless of whether OpenAI hits its revenue
   targets
  - Post-bubble, this capacity becomes cheaper—accelerating adoption (just
  like fiber post-2000)

  Frame 2: Technology Doesn't Disappear
  - Even if OpenAI/Anthropic fail, their models, training methodologies, and
   talent get absorbed
  - Microsoft has legal protection (Section 365(n)) + 27% stake + $13B
  invested
  - Google/Amazon have strategic stakes in Anthropic
  - Historical precedent: Nortel's patents were acquired for $4.5B and
  continued to be used

  Frame 3: Economic Pressure Accelerates, Not Slows
  - 2008 data: Automation orders increased during recession while general
  manufacturing tech dropped 60%
  - Academic finding: "The Great Recession accelerated adoption of
  routine-biased technologies"
  - Companies under cost pressure automate—they don't hire

  The Math:
  Current AI infrastructure investment: ~$400-500B
  This creates capacity that will exist post-bubble

  If bubble pops → infrastructure becomes cheaper → adoption accelerates
  If bubble doesn't pop → companies continue building → adoption continues

  Either path → displacement

  The only question is timeline and who captures value

  ---
  What This Means for Your Valuation Argument

  The valuation question becomes: Are current prices justified by the 
  inevitable displacement, or only justified if specific companies survive?

  If displacement happens regardless (which the evidence suggests):
  - Infrastructure valuations (Nvidia): Probably justified—someone needs the
   chips
  - Application valuations (OpenAI at $500B): Questionable as standalone,
  but the aggregate value created still materializes somewhere
  - Big tech valuations (Microsoft, Google, Amazon): Probably
  justified—they'll either profit from their stakes or acquire the
  technology post-crash

  The bubble, if it pops, is a redistribution event, not a destruction
  event.
